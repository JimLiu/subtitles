00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm thrilled to present to you this short course on diffusion models taught by Sharon Zhou.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:20,000
Mid-journey, stable diffusion, DALL-E, and others are able to generate an image, sometimes a beautiful image, given only a prompt.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
How do these algorithms work?

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,444
You may have heard of a vague description of these algorithms learning to subtract noise to generate an image,

5
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:35,329
but in this short course, Sharon will step you through a concrete implementation of image generation using a diffusion model

6
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:40,320
so that you understand the technical details of exactly how it works.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,800
Cool, thanks Andrew.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,800
In this course, you'll be learning about the current state and capabilities of diffusion models used today.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:55,440
You'll start by understanding the sampling process, starting with pure noise and progressively refining it to obtain a final nice-looking image.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,080
You'll build the necessary programming skills to train a diffusion model effectively.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,200
You'll learn how to build a neural network that can predict noise in an image.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,160
You'll add context to the model so that you can control what you want it to generate.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,520
And finally, by implementing advanced algorithms, you'll learn how to accelerate the sampling process by a factor of 10.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,340
This is an intermediate to advanced course.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,360
We assume you're familiar with Python and basic neural network training.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,560
So for example, we'll assume you know what backpropagation is.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,480
We'll use PyTorch throughout.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,820
But if you're familiar with other machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, you should be able to follow along just fine.

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:42,620
And so the running example we'll use for this short course will be generating 16 by 16 sprites, like those little 8-bit characters used in video games.

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,400
We chose this example so that it's feasible for you to not just go through the notebooks,

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,040
but also run them yourself to generate cute sprites yourself right there in that Jupyter Notebook.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,200
Diffusion models are becoming a foundation for cutting-edge research in the life sciences and other sectors too.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,560
For example, generating molecules for drug discovery.

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,146
So when you understand the technical details of diffusion models,

25
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:13,720
you'll also be in a better position to understand and perhaps apply such models yourself.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,680
Many people worked together to build this short course.

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,360
I want to thank Aaron Lou and Mehmet Giray Ogut for their significant contributions.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,200
And on the DeepLearning.ai site, also Geoff Ladwig and Eddy Shyu.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,800
So with that, let me hand it over to Sharon, and I hope you enjoy the course.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Great.

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,440
Let's get started.
