00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
In this video, your goal is to gain some intuition of diffusion models.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
First, we'll talk about the goal of the diffusion model,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then we'll talk through how the training data that you have of different sprites

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
can be made useful to these models,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
and then we'll talk about training the models themselves on this data.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
What is the goal of diffusion models?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,131
Well, you have a lot of training data,

8
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:30,000
such as these sprite images that you see down here of video game characters.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And this is your training dataset.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And what you want is you want even more of these sprites that are not represented in your training dataset.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,500
And you can use a neural network that can generate more of these sprites for you following the diffusion model process.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,000
So now, how do we make these images useful to the neural network?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Well, you want the neural network to learn generally the concept of a sprite, what it is.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,500
And that could be finer details, such as, you know, the hair color of the sprite or that it's wearing a buckle for its belt.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,500
But it also could be general outlines, like of its head and body, and everything in between that.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,961
And one way to do that, one way to kind of take your data and be able to emphasize either finer details

17
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:17,000
or general outlines is actually to add different levels of noise.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,500
So this is just adding noise to the image.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,000
And it's known as a noising process.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,500
And this is inspired by physics.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,000
You can imagine an ink drop into a glass of water.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Initially, you know exactly where the ink drop landed.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But over time, you actually see it diffuse into the water until it disappears.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,500
And that's the same idea here, where you start with Bob the sprite,

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,000
and as you add noise, it will disappear until you have no idea which sprite it actually was.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,500
And so what should the neural network really be thinking at each of these levels of noise

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
when you add progressively more noise to the image?

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Well, when it's Bob the sprite, you want the neural network to say,

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,000
"Yeah, that's Bob the sprite," to keep Bob as is.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,500
That is a sprite.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
If it's probably Bob, if it's likely to be Bob,

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
then you probably want the neural network to say, you know,

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
"There's some noise on here."

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Suggest possible details to make it look just like Bob the sprite.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
And if it's just an outline of a sprite now,

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,500
here you can only get a sense that this is probably a sprite person,

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,000
but it could be Bob or Fred or maybe even Nancy,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then you want to suggest more general details for possible likely sprites.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So maybe you'll suggest some details for Bob based on this,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,500
or you'll suggest some details for Fred.

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
And finally, if you have no idea, if it looks like absolutely nothing,

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
you still want it to look more like a sprite.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You still want the neural network to say, "You know what?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to still take this completely noisy image,

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and I'm going to turn this into something that's slightly more sprite-like

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,500
by proposing an outline of what a sprite might look like."

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
All right, so let's take a look at what that noising process,

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,500
that process of adding noise progressively, looks like over time.

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,500
And there it goes, an ink drop that's fully diffused in a glass of water.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
So now on to training that neural network.

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
So it learns to take different noisy images and turn them back into sprites.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,000
That is your goal.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
And how it does that is it learns to remove the noise you added,

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,500
starting with the no idea level, where it is just pure noise,

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
to starting to give a semblance of maybe there's a person in there,

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,500
to looking like Fred, and then finally a sprite that looks like Fred.

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:37,500
And I just want to call out that the no idea level of noise is really important because it is normally distributed.

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
And what I mean by that is each of those pixels is sampled from a normal distribution,

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,500
also known as a Gaussian distribution or a bell-shaped curve.

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
So when you want to ask the neural network for a new sprite, such as Fred here,

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
you can sample noise from that normal distribution,

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,500
and then you can get a completely new sprite by using the neural network to just remove that noise progressively.

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
So now you've reached your goal.

64
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
You can get even more sprites beyond all those that you had trained on.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
In the next video, we'll cover sampling.
