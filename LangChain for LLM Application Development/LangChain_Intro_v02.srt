Welcome to this short course on LangChain for large language model application development.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:18,600
By prompting an LLM or large language model, it is now possible to develop AI applications much faster than ever before.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,760
But an application can require prompting an LLM multiple times and parsing its output.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,240
And so there's a lot of glue code that needs to be written.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,320
LangChain created by Harrison Chase makes this development process much easier.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm thrilled to have Harrison here, who had built this short course in collaboration with deeplearning.ai to teach how to use this amazing tool.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,400
Thanks for having me. I'm really excited to be here.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,760
LangChain started as an open source framework for building LLM applications.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:59,520
It came about when I was talking to a bunch of folks in the field who were building more complex applications and saw some common abstractions in terms of how they were being developed.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,120
And we've been really thrilled at the community adoption of LangChain so far.

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,880
And so look forward to sharing it with everyone here and look forward to seeing what people build with it.

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:18,800
And in fact, as a sign of LangChain's momentum, not only does it have numerous users, but there are also many hundreds of contributors to the open source.

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,720
And this has been instrumental for its rapid rate of development.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,440
This team really ships code and features at an amazing pace.

15
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,680
So hopefully, after this short course, you'll be able to quickly put together some really cool applications using LangChain.

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,760
And who knows, maybe you even decide to contribute back to the open source LangChain effort.

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,320
LangChain is an open source development framework for building LLM applications.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,520
We have two different packages, a Python one and a JavaScript(TypeScript) one.

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,600
They're focused on composition and modularity.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,320
So they have a lot of individual components that can be used in conjunction with each other or by themselves.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,080
And so that's one of the key value adds.

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,640
And then the other key value add is a bunch of different use cases.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:12,600
So chains of ways of combining these modular components into more end-to-end applications and making it very easy to get started with those use cases.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,040
In this class, we'll cover the common components of LangChain.

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
So we'll talk about models.

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,040
We'll talk about prompts, which are how you get models to do useful and interesting things.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,920
We'll talk about indexes, which are ways of ingesting data so that you can combine it with models.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
And then we'll talk about chains,

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,280
which are more end-to-end use cases along with agents,

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,920
which are a very exciting type of end-to-end use case,

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,680
which uses the model as a reasoning engine.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,360
We're also grateful to Ankush Gola,

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,600
who is the co-founder of LangChain alongside Harrison Chase,

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,480
for also putting a lot of thoughts into these materials and helping with the creation of this short course.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,840
And on the deep learning, the AI side, Geoff Ladwig, Eddie Shyu, and Diala Ezzedine have also contributed to these materials.

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,960
And so with that, let's go on to the next video where we'll learn about LangChain's: Models, Prompts, and Parsers.
