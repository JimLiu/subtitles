00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Congratulations and thank you for getting to the end of this short course.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,240
As we conclude the course, let's recap the main topics we covered.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,960
We went over details of how an LM works, including subtleties like the tokenizer and why it can't reverse lollipop.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,570
We learned methods for evaluating user inputs to ensure the quality and safety of the system, 

5
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:29,200
processing inputs using both chain of thought reasoning and splitting tasks into subtasks with chain prompts and checking outputs before showing them to users.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,000
We also took a look at methods for evaluating the system over time, so as to monitor and improve its performance.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,670
Throughout the course, we also discussed the importance of building responsibly with these tools, 

8
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:47,240
ensuring that the model is safe and provides appropriate responses that are accurate, relevant, and in the tone you want.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,200
As always, practice is key to mastering these concepts, so we hope you'll apply what you've learned in your own projects.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,560
And so that's it.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,240
There are so many exciting applications that are yet to be built.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,271
The world needs more people like you building useful applications, 

13
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,240
and we look forward to hearing about the amazing things you build.
