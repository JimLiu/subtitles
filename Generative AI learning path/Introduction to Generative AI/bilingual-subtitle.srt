12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:44,089
但什么是人工智能？
But what is artificial intelligence?

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,030
嗯，既然我们要探讨
Well, since we are going to explore

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,559
生成式人工智能，
generative artificial intelligence,

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,129
那么让我们提供一些背景信息。
let's provide a bit of context.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,139
所以两个非常常见的问题是
So two very common questions asked

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,809
什么是人工智能
are what is artificial intelligence

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,219
以及人工智能和机器
and what is the difference between AI and machine

19
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,479
学习之间的区别是什么。
learning.

20
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,858
可以这样认为，AI是一门学科，
One way to think about it is that AI is a discipline,

21
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,289
例如物理学。
like physics for example.

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,230
AI是计算机科学的一个分支
AI is a branch of computer science

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,009
它涉及到智能代理的创建，这些代理
that deals with the creation of intelligence agents, which

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,549
是可以推理、学习和自主行动的系统。
are systems that can reason, and learn, and act autonomously.

25
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,688
从本质上讲，AI与理论和方法有关
Essentially, AI has to do with the theory and methods

26
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,189
构建像人类一样思考和行动的机器。
to build machines that think and act like humans.

27
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,019
在这个学科中，我们有机器学习，
In this discipline, we have machine learning,

28
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,588
它是AI的一个子领域。
which is a subfield of AI.

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,209
这是一个从输入数据中训练模型的程序或系统。
It is a program or system that trains a model from input data.

30
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,818
经过训练的模型可以对
That trained model can make useful predictions

31
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,879
从未见过的新数据进行有用的预测，
from new or never before seen data

32
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,959
这些数据来自于用于训练模型的相同数据。
drawn from the same one used to train the model.

33
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,939
机器学习赋予计算机
Machine learning gives the computer

34
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:56,469
在没有明确编程的情况下学习的能力。

35
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,439
两种最常见的机器学习模型类别
Two of the most common classes of machine learning models

36
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,788
是无监督和有监督的ML模型。
are unsupervised and supervised ML models.

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,739
两者之间的关键区别
The key difference between the two

38
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,667
是有监督模型具有标签。
is that, with supervised models, we have labels.

39
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,680
带标签的数据是带有标签的数据，如名称、类型、
Labeled data is data that comes with a tag like a name, a type,

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
或数字。
or a number.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,629
无标签数据是没有标签的数据。
Unlabeled data is data that comes with no tag.

42
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,388
这张图是一个例子，
This graph is an example of the problem

43
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:26,208
说明了有监督模型可能尝试解决的问题。
that a supervised model might try to solve.

44
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,779
例如，假设您是一家餐厅的老板。
For example, let's say you are the owner of a restaurant.

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,369
您拥有账单金额的历史数据
You have historical data of the bill amount

46
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,139
以及基于订单类型不同人给予的小费
and how much different people tipped based on order type

47
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,498
以及是自取还是送货上门。
and whether it was picked up or delivered.

48
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,979
在监督学习中，模型通过过去的例子学习
In supervised learning, the model learns from past examples

49
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:47,238
来预测未来的值，本例中是小费。
to predict future values, in this case tips.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,969
所以在这里，模型使用总账单金额
So here the model uses the total bill amount

51
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:57,019
根据订单是自取还是送货上门来预测未来的小费金额。
to predict the future tip amount based on whether an order was picked up or delivered.

52
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,840
这是一个例子
This is an example of the problem

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,330
无监督模型可能尝试解决的问题。
that an unsupervised model might try to solve.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,080
所以在这里你想看的是工龄和收入
So here you want to look at tenure and income

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,050
然后对员工进行分组或聚类
and then group or cluster employees

56
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,169
看看某个人是否在快速发展的道路上。
to see whether someone is on the fast track.

57
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:14,528
无监督问题都是关于发现的，
Unsupervised problems are all about discovery,

58
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,939
关于观察原始数据，看它是否自然地
about looking at the raw data and seeing if it naturally

59
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,749
分成几组。
falls into groups.

60
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,649
让我们更深入地用图形展示这些概念，
Let's get a little deeper and show this graphically

61
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,529
因为理解这些概念是
as understanding these concepts are

62
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,789
你理解生成式AI的基础。
the foundation for your understanding of generative AI.

63
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:35,869
在监督学习中，测试数据值或x
In supervised learning, testing data values or x

64
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,879
被输入到模型中。
are input into the model.

65
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,499
模型输出预测并将该预测
The model outputs a prediction and compares that prediction

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,859
与用于训练模型的训练数据进行比较。
to the training data used to train the model.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,749
如果预测的测试数据值和实际训练数据值
If the predicted test data values and actual training data

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,379
相差很大，那就叫做误差。
values are far apart, that's called error.

69
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,928
模型试图减少这种误差，
And the model tries to reduce this error

70
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,580
直到预测值和实际值更接近为止。
until the predicted and actual values are closer together.

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,709
这是一个经典的优化问题。
This is a classic optimization problem.

72
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,409
现在我们已经探讨了
Now that we've explored the difference

73
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,469
人工智能和机器学习之间的区别，
between artificial intelligence and machine learning,

74
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,859
以及监督学习和无监督学习，

89
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,529
这被称为半监督学习。

90
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,259
在半监督学习中，神经网络

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,389
融入这个AI学科的地方。
fits into this AI discipline.

99
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,569
生成式AI是深度学习的一个子集，
Gen AI is a subset of deep learning, which

100
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,539
这意味着它使用人工神经网络，

104
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,309
深度学习模型，或者一般的机器学习模型，

105
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,634
可以分为两种类型，生成式和判别式。
can be divided into two types, generative and discriminative.

106
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:02,288
判别模型是一种类型的模型

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,180
它可以用来预测新数据点的标签。

114
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,389
生成模型根据现有数据的概率分布生成新的数据实例
A generative model generates new data instances

115
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,608
基于学习到的概率分布。
based on a learned probability distribution of existing data.

116
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,069
因此生成模型会生成新内容。
Thus generative models generate new content.

117
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,258
以这个例子为例。
Take this example here.

118
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,989
判别模型学习条件概率

00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,069
我们的输出，给定x，我们的输入，这是一只狗
our output, given x, our input, that this is a dog

121
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,479
并将其分类为狗而不是猫。
and classifies it as a dog and not a cat.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,259
生成模型学习联合概率分布
The generative model learns the joint probability distribution

123
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,098
或者x和y的概率，并预测
or the probability of x and y and predicts

124
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,249
这是一只狗的条件概率
the conditional probability that this is a dog

125
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,429
然后可以生成一张狗的图片。
and can then generate a picture of a dog.

126
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,970
所以总结一下，生成模型
So to summarize, generative models

127
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,529
可以生成新的数据实例，而判别模型
can generate new data instances while discriminative models

128
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:21,469
在不同类型的数据实例之间进行区分。

135
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,100
可以生成新的内容。
can generate new content.

136
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,839
区分什么是通用人工智能和什么不是的一个好方法

137
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,368
就是通过这幅插图来展示。

138
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,379
当输出、或者y、或者标签是
It is not gen AI when the output, or y, or label is

139
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,758
一个数字或一个类别，例如垃圾邮件或非垃圾邮件，
a number or a class, for example spam or not spam,

140
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,619
或者一个概率时，它不是通用人工智能。
or a probability.

141
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,169
当输出是自然语言，如语音
It is gen AI when the output is natural language, like speech

142
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,610
或文本、图像或音频等时，它是通用人工智能。
or text, an image or audio, for example.

143
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,029
从数学角度来看，这样的可视化效果如下。
Visualizing this mathematically would look like this.

144
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,339
如果你已经有一段时间没有见过这个了，
