1
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:06,920
 Today's guest really doesn't need any introduction.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,100
 I think I first met Eric about 25 years ago

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,580
 when he came to Stanford Business School as CEO of Novell.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,800
 He's done a few things since

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,580
 then at Google starting I think 2001

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,860
 and Schmidt Futures starting in 2017

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,760
 and done a whole

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,340
 bunch of other things you can read about.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,580
 But he can only be here until 5.15 so I thought

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,320
 we dive right into some questions.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,680
 And I know you guys have sent some as well.

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,580
 I have a

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,980
bunch written here, 

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,840
but what we just talked about upstairs was even more interesting.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,460
 So I'm just going to start with that, Eric, if that's okay.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,620
 Which is, where do you see

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,620
 AI going in the short term, which I think you defined as the next year or two?

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,900
 Things have changed so fast,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,020
 I feel like every six months I need to sort of give a new speech

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,800
 on what's going to happen.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,660
 Can anybody here, a bunch of computer scientists in here, can

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,520
 Can anybody explain what a million token context window is

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,380
 for the rest of the class?

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,140
 Over here.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,420
 So say your name.

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,480
 Tell us what it does.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,020
 OK.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,760
 Basically, it allows you to prompt with a million tokens,

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,540
 or a million words, or whatever.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,640
 So you can ask a million word question.

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,920
 So I know this is a very large direction in Gen Ed right now.

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,720
 No, no, they're going to 10.

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,380
 Yes, 10 million? Yes.

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,260
 And then Anthropic is at 200,000 going to a million,

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,180
 and so forth.

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,800
 You can imagine OpenAI has a similar goal.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,280
 Anybody, can anybody here give a technical definition

38
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,900
 of an AI agent?

39
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,540
 Again, I figure you're scientists.

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,180
 Yes, sir.

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,140
 - My name's Jared.

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,140
 An AI agent is largely something that acts

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,720
 in some kind of way.

44
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,580
 So that might be calling things on the web,

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,340
things on your behalf, it could be a number of different things, 

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,380
along these lines.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,980
 There are various things that are possible.

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,680
 So an agent is something that does some kind of a task.

49
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,600
 Another definition would be that it's an LLM, state and memory.

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,480
 Can anybody, again, computer scientists, can any of you define text to action?

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,740
 Taking text and turning it into an action.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,400
 Right here.

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:27,960
 Go ahead.

54
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:28,840
 Yes.

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,980
 Instead of taking text and turning it into more text.

56
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,580
 More text.

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,480
 Taking text and have the AI trigger actions.

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
 So another definition would be language to Python.

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,660
 a programming language I never wanted to see survive.

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,360
 And everything in AI is being done in Python.

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,220
 There's a new language called Mojo that has just come out,

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,020
 which looks like they finally have addressed AI programming.

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,260
 But we'll see if that actually survives over the dominance

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,760
 of Python.

65
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,760
 One more technical question.

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,140
 Why is NVIDIA worth $2 trillion and the other companies

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,800
 are struggling?

68
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,180
 Technical answer.

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,100
I mean, I think it just boils down to like, 

70
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,860
most of the code needs to run with CUDA optimizations 

71
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,120
that currently only NVIDIA GPU supports, 

72
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,860
so like, other companies can make whatever they want to, 

73
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,080
but unless they have the 10 years of software there, 

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
you don't have the machine learning optimizations.

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,940
 I like to think of CUDA as the C programming language for GPUs.

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 Right?

77
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,820
 That's the way I like to think of it.

78
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,080
 It was founded in 2008.

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,800
 I always thought it was a terrible language.

80
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,020
 And yet it's become dominant.

81
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,500
 There's another insight.

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,880
 There's a set of open source libraries, which

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,420
 are highly optimized to CUDA and not anything else.

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,160
 And everybody who builds all these stacks--

85
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,760
 this is completely missed in any of the discussions.

86
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,980
 It's technically called VLLM and a whole bunch of libraries

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,400
 like that.

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,880
 Highly optimized CUDA, very hard to replicate that

89
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,520
 if you're a competitor.

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,040
 So what does all this mean?

91
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,279
 In the next year, you're going to see very large context

92
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,899
 windows, agents and text to action, when they are delivered at scale,

93
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,260
 it's going to have an impact

94
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,360
 on the world at a scale that no one understands yet.

95
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,140
 Much bigger than the horrific impact we've

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,560
 had on by social media, right, in my view.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,060
 So here's why.

98
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 In a context window, you can basically

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,300
 use that as short-term memory.

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,060
 And I was shocked that context windows get this long.

101
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,679
 The technical

102
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,440
reasons have to do with the fact that it's hard to serve, hard to calculate, 

103
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,020
and so forth.

104
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:42,540
 The

105
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,360
 interesting thing about short-term memory is when you feed,

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,900
 you're asking a question, "Read 20 books,

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,400
 you give it the text of the books as the query, and you say,

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,080
 'Tell me what they say.'" It forgets

109
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,140
 the middle, which is exactly how human brains work, too.

110
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:58,880
 Right?

111
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,780
 That's where we are.

112
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:00,640
 With

113
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,580
 respect to agents,

114
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,160
 there are people who are now building essentially LLM agents, and the way they

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,560
they do it is they read something like chemistry, 

116
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,320
they discover the principles of chemistry, and then they test it.

117
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,820
 And then they add that back into their understanding.

118
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,560
 Right?

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,620
 That's extremely powerful.

120
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,900
 And then the third thing, as I mentioned, is text to action.

121
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,820
So I'll give you an example, 

122
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,440
the government is in the process of trying to ban Tick Tock, 

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,620
we'll see if that actually happens.

124
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,080
If Tick Tock is banned, here's what I propose each and every one of you do, 

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,620
say to your LLM, the follow up.

126
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,700
 Make me a copy of TikTok.

127
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,980
 Steal all the users.

128
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,300
 Steal all the music.

129
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,500
 Put my preferences in it.

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,500
 Produce this program in the next 30 seconds.

131
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,740
 Release it.

132
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,060
And in one hour, if it's not viral, 

133
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,200
do something different along the same lines.

134
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,220
 That's the command.

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,120
 Boom, boom, boom, boom.

136
00:05:59,660 --> 00:05:59,820
 Right?

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,300
 You understand how powerful that is.

138
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,900
If you can go from arbitrary language to arbitrary digital command, 

139
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,460
which is essentially what Python in this scenario is, 

140
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,400
imagine that each and every human on the planet 

141
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,840
has their own programmer 

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,580
that actually does what they want, 

143
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
as opposed to the programmers that work for me who don't do what I ask.

144
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,480
 Right?

145
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
 The programmers here know what I'm talking about.

146
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,180
So imagine a non-arrogant programmer that actually does what you want, 

147
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,280
and you don't have to pay all that money to.

148
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,640
 And there's infinite supply of these programs.

149
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,260
 And this is all within the next year or two?

150
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,960
 Very soon.

151
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Those three things, 

152
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,760
and I'm quite convinced 

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,660
it's the union of those three things 

154
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,360
that will happen in the next wave.

155
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,960
 So, you asked about what else is going to happen.

156
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,960
 Every six months I oscillate, so we're on a, it's an even-odd oscillation.

157
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,740
 So at the moment, the gap between the frontier models,

158
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
 which there are now only three, I'll

159
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,880
 review who they are, and everybody else, appears to me to be getting larger.

160
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,680
 Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller.

161
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,580
 So I invested lots of money in the little companies.

162
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,100
 Now I'm not so sure.

163
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,760
 And I'm talking to the big companies,

164
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,800
 and the big companies are telling me that they

165
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,520
 need 10 billion, 20 billion, 50 billion, 100 billion.

166
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,580
 Stargate is 100 billion, right?

167
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,420
 They're very, very hard.

168
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,220
 Sam Altman is a close friend.

169
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,240
 He believes that it's going to take about 300 billion, maybe more.

170
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,020
I pointed out to him 

171
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
that I'd done the calculation 

172
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,760
on the amount of energy required.

173
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,020
 And I then, in the spirit of full disclosure,

174
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,180
 went to the White House on Friday and told

175
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,960
 them that we need to become best friends with Canada.

176
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,920
Because Canada has really nice people, helped invent AI, 

177
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,680
and lots of hydropower.

178
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,700
 Because we as a country do not have enough power to do this.

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,680
 The alternative is to have the Arabs fund it.

180
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,340
 And I like the Arabs personally.

181
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,920
 I've spent lots of time there, right?

182
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,000
 But they're not going to adhere to our national security rules,

183
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,760
 whereas Canada and the US

184
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,060
 are part of a triumvirate where we all agree on security.

185
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,560
So these $300 billion data centers, 

186
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,140
electricity starts becoming the scarce resource.

187
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,780
And by the way, if you follow this line of reasoning, 

188
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,040
why did I discuss CUDA and NVIDIA?

189
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,700
If $300 billion is all going to go to NVIDIA, 

190
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
you know what to do in the stock market.

191
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,299
 That's not a stock recommendation.

192
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,240
 I'm not a licensor.

193
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,220
 (audience laughing)

194
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,400
 Well, part of it, so we're gonna need a lot more chips,

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,419
 but Intel is getting a lot of money

196
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,060
 from the US government, AMD, and they're trying to build,

197
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,780
 you know, fabs in Korea.

198
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,860
 - Raise your hand if you have an Intel computer,

199
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,980
 an Intel chip in any of your computing devices.

200
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,280
 Okay, so much for the monopoly.

201
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,520
 - Well, that's the point, though.

202
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,680
 They once did have a monopoly.

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,080
 - Absolutely.

204
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
 - And Nvidia has a monopoly now.

205
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
 So are those barriers to entry?

206
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,400
 Like CUDA, is there something that other,

207
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,080
 so I was talking to Percy, Percy Lanny the other day.

208
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,860
 He's switching between TPUs and NVIDIA chips,

209
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,820
 depending on what he can get access to for training models.

210
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,960
 - That's because he doesn't have a choice.

211
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,060
 If he had infinite money, he would,

212
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,080
 today he would pick the B200 architecture out of NVIDIA,

213
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,940
 because it would be faster.

214
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,880
 And I'm not suggesting, I mean,

215
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,920
 it's great to have competition.

216
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,640
 I've talked to AMD and Lisa Su at great length.

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,160
 they have built a thing which will translate

218
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,640
 from this CUDA architecture that you were describing

219
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,580
 to their own, which is called ROCm.

220
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,840
 It doesn't quite work yet.

221
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,440
 They're working on it.

222
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,220
 - You were at Google for a long time,

223
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,320
 and they invented the transformer architecture.

224
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,640
 - Peter, Peter.

225
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
 It's all Peter's fault.

226
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,580
 - Thanks to brilliant people over there,

227
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,200
 like Peter and Jeff Dean and everyone.

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,260
 But now it doesn't seem like they're,

229
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,680
 They've kind of lost the initiative to open AI.

230
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,960
 And even the last leaderboard I saw, Anthropic's Claude,

231
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,240
 was at the top of the list.

232
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,280
 I asked Sundar this.

233
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,060
 He didn't really give me a very sharp answer.

234
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,540
 Maybe you have a sharper or more objective explanation

235
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,540
 for what's going on there.

236
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
 I'm no longer a Google employee.

237
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:21,980
 Yes.

238
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,780
 In the spirit of full disclosure,

239
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,860
 Google decided that work-life balance, and going home early,

240
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,180
 and working from home was more important than winning.

241
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,640
 (laughing)

242
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,880
 And the startups, the reason startups work

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,860
 is because the people work like hell.

244
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,860
 And I'm sorry to be so blunt, but the fact of the matter

245
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,820
 is if you all leave the university and go found a company,

246
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,600
 you're not gonna let people work from home

247
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,720
 and only come in one day a week if you wanna compete

248
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,080
 against the other startups.

249
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,640
 - When in the early days of Google,

250
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,160
 Microsoft was like that.

251
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,620
 - Exactly.

252
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,260
 - But now it seems to be--

253
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,440
 history of, in my industry, our industry I guess,

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
 of companies winning in a genuinely

255
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,320
 creative way and really dominating a space and not making the next transition.

256
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,200
 It's very

257
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,900
 well documented.

258
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,740
 And I think that the truth is, founders are special, the founders need

259
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,600
to be in charge, the founders are difficult to work with, 

260
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,000
they push people hard.

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,540
 As much

262
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,500
 as we can dislike Elon's personal behavior, look at what he gets out of people.

263
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,540
 I had

264
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,600
 dinner with him and he was flying, I was in Montana,

265
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,700
 he was flying that night at 10pm

266
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,100
 to have a meeting at midnight with X.AI.

267
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,340
 Right?

268
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,440
 Think about it.

269
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,360
 I was in Taiwan, different

270
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,280
 country, different culture, and they said that, this is TSMC,

271
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,300
 who I'm very impressed

272
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,620
and they have a rule that the starting PhDs coming out of the, 

273
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,120
they're good physicists, work in the factory on the basement floor.

274
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,420
 Now can you imagine getting American physicists to do that?

275
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,840
 The PhDs?

276
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,520
 Highly unlikely.

277
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,640
 Different work ethic.

278
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,440
And the problem here, 

279
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,960
the reason I'm being so harsh about work is 

280
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,440
that these are systems 

281
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,560
which have network effects, 

282
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
so time matters a lot.

283
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,380
 And in most businesses, time doesn't matter that much.

284
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
 You have lots of time.

285
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,420
 Coke and Pepsi will still be around,

286
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,400
 and the fight between Coke and Pepsi

287
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,800
 will continue to go on, and it's all glacial.

288
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,940
 When I dealt with telcos, the typical telco deal

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,200
 would take 18 months to sign.

290
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,260
 There's no reason to take 18 months to do anything.

291
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,920
 Get it done.

292
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,580
 We're in a period of maximum growth, maximum gain.

293
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,780
 And also it takes crazy ideas.

294
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,920
 Like when Microsoft did the OpenAI deal,

295
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,760
 I thought that was the stupidest idea I'd ever heard.

296
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,360
 Outsourcing essentially your AI leadership to OpenAI,

297
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,000
 and Sam and his team, I mean, that's insane.

298
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,400
 Nobody would do that at Microsoft or anywhere else.

299
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,920
 And yet today, they're on their way

300
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,240
 to being the most valuable company.

301
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
 They're certainly head to head in Apple.

302
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,100
 Apple does not have a good AI solution,

303
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,960
 and it looks like they made it work.

304
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,320
 Yes, sir.

305
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,780
 In terms of national security or geopolitical interests,

306
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,020
 how do you think AI is going to play a role or competition

307
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,780
 with China as well?

308
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,240
 So I was the chairman of an AI commission that sort of looked

309
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,060
 at this very carefully.

310
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,780
 And you can read it.

311
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,560
 It's about 752 pages.

312
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,440
 And I'll just summarize it by saying we're ahead.

313
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,500
 We need to stay ahead.

314
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,280
 And we need lots of money to do so.

315
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,580
 Our customers were the Senate and the House.

316
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,080
 And out of that came the CHIPS Act and a lot of other stuff

317
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,520
 like that.

318
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,780
 A rough scenario is that if you assume the frontier models drive forward and

319
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,380
 a few of the open source models,

320
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,640
 it's likely that a very small number of companies can

321
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,460
 play this game.

322
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
 Countries, excuse me.

323
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,380
 What are those countries or who are they?

324
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,020
 Countries

325
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,080
with a lot of money and a lot of talent, 

326
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,260
strong educational systems and a willingness to win.

327
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,380
 The US is one of them.

328
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,020
 China is another one.

329
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,580
 How many others are there?

330
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,540
 Are there any others?

331
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,560
 I don't know, maybe.

332
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,640
But certainly in your lifetimes, 

333
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,220
the battle between the US and China 

334
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,060
for knowledge supremacy 

335
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,280
is going to be the big fight.

336
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,300
So the US government banned essentially the NVIDIA chips, 

337
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,420
although they weren't allowed to say that was what they were doing, 

338
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,520
but they actually did that into China.

339
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,940
 They have about a 10-year chip advantage.

340
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,940
We have a roughly 10-year chip advantage in terms of sub-DUV, 

341
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
that is sub-5-nanometer chips.

342
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:43,960
 10 years, that long?

343
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,660
 Roughly 10 years.

344
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,020
 Wow.

345
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,780
 And so an example would be, today we're a couple of years ahead of China.

346
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,120
 My guess is we'll get a few more years ahead of China.

347
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,820
 And the Chinese are whopping mad about this.

348
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,480
 It's like hugely upset about it.

349
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,260
 So that's a big deal.

350
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
That was the decision made by the Trump administration 

351
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,980
and proved by the Biden administration.

352
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,300
Do you find that the administration today 

353
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,600
and Congress is listening to your advice?

354
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,100
 Do you think that it's going to make that scale of investment?

355
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,700
 I mean, obviously the CHIPS Act, but beyond that, building a massive AI system?

356
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:25,480
 So as you know, I lead an informal, ad hoc, non-legal group.

357
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,900
 That's different from illegal.

358
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,060
 Exactly, just to be clear.

359
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,120
 Which includes all the usual suspects.

360
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,980
And the usual suspects over the last year 

361
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,400
came up with the basis of the reasoning 

362
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:46,460
that became the Biden Administration's AI Act, 

363
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,800
which is the longest presidential directive in history.

364
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,180
 You're talking about the Special Competitive Studies Project?

365
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,220
 No, this is the actual act from the executive office.

366
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,780
 And they're busy implementing the details.

367
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,620
 So far, they've got it right.

368
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,360
 And so, for example,

369
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,320
 one of the debates that we had for the last year has been, how do

370
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,500
you detect danger in a system which has learned it, 

371
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,260
but you don't know what to ask it?

372
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,280
 OK, so in other words, it's a core-- it's sort of a core problem.

373
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,780
 to learn something bad, but it can't tell you what it learned,

374
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,600
 and you don't know what

375
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,120
 to ask it.

376
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,260
 And there's so many threats, right?

377
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,220
 Like it learned how to mix chemistry in some

378
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,080
 new way that you don't know how to ask it.

379
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,800
 And so people are working hard on that.

380
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:32,960
 But

381
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,920
 we ultimately wrote in our memos to them that there was a threshold,

382
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,560
 which we arbitrarily

383
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,600
 named as 10 to the 26 flops, which technically is a measure of computation,

384
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,060
 that above that

385
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,140
 threshold, you had to report to the government that you were

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,660
 doing this.

387
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
 And that's part of the rule.

388
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,360
 The EU, to just make

389
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,220
 sure they were different, did it 10 to the 25.

390
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:55,740
 Yeah.

391
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,940
 But it's all

392
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,860
 kind of close enough.

393
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,960
 I think all of these distinctions go

394
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,660
 away, because the technology will now - the technical term is

395
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,119
 called federated training, where basically you can take pieces

396
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,180
 and union them together.

397
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,400
 So we may not be able to keep people

398
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,740
 safe from these new things.

399
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,960
Well, rumors are that that's how OpenAI has had to train, 

400
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,300
partly because of the power consumption.

401
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,400
 There's no one place where they did.

402
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,160
 Well, let's talk about a real war that's going on.

403
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,260
I know that something you've been very involved in is the Ukraine war, 

404
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,060
and in particular, 

405
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,820
I don't know how much you can talk about White Stork 

406
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,760
and your goal of having $500 drones 

407
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,380
destroy $5 million tanks.

408
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,480
 How's that changing warfare?

409
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,580
 I worked for the Secretary of Defense for seven years,

410
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,680
 and tried to change the way we run our military.

411
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,860
 I'm not a particularly big fan of the military,

412
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,840
 but it's very expensive,

413
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,440
 and I wanted to see if I could be helpful.

414
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,860
 And I think, in my view, I largely failed.

415
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,160
 They gave me a medal,

416
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,020
 so they must give medalists to failure, or, you know, whatever.

417
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,580
 But my self-criticism was, nothing has really changed,

418
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,220
 and the system in America is not gonna lead

419
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,460
 to real innovation.

420
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,460
 So watching the Russians use tanks to destroy apartment

421
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
 buildings with little old ladies and kids

422
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,980
 just drove me crazy.

423
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,200
 So I decided to work on a company with your friend,

424
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,380
 Sebastian Thrun, as a former faculty member here,

425
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,080
 and a whole bunch of Stanford people.

426
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,760
 And the idea basically is to do two things.

427
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
 Use AI in complicated, powerful ways

428
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,160
 for these essentially robotic war,

429
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,260
 And the second one is to lower the cost of the robots.

430
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,500
 Now you sit there and you go, why would a good liberal

431
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,500
 like me do that?

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,340
 And the answer is that the whole theory of armies

433
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,260
 is tanks, artilleries, and mortar,

434
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,580
 and we can eliminate all of them.

435
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,980
 And we can make the penalty for invading a country,

436
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,200
 at least by land, essentially be impossible.

437
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,940
 It should eliminate the kind of land battles.

438
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,860
 - Well, this is a really interesting question,

439
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,880
 is that does it give more of an advantage to defense

440
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,240
 Can you even make that distinction?

441
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
 - Because I've been doing this for the last year,

442
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,020
 I've learned a lot about war

443
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,720
 that I really did not want to know.

444
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,600
 And one of the things to know about war

445
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
 is that the offense always has the advantage

446
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,600
 because you can always overwhelm the defensive systems.

447
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,900
 And so you're better off as a strategy of national defense

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,680
 to have a very strong offense

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,440
 that you can use if you need to.

450
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,920
 And the systems that I and others are building will do that.

451
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,900
 Because of the way the system works,

452
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,180
 I am now a licensed arms dealer.

453
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,440
 So, computer scientist, businessman, arms dealer.

454
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,980
 (laughing)

455
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,140
 And I'm sorry to say-- - Is that a progression?

456
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,960
 - I don't know, I do not recommend this in your career path.

457
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,760
 I'd stick with AI.

458
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,740
 And because of the way the laws work,

459
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,520
 we're doing this privately, and then this is all legal

460
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
 with the support of the government,

461
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
 so you go straight into the Ukraine,

462
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,980
 and then they fight the war.

463
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,140
 And without going into all the details,

464
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,480
 things are pretty bad.

465
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,100
 I think if in May or June, if the Russians build up

466
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,120
 as they are expected to, Ukraine will lose a whole chunk

467
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,900
 of its territory and will begin the process

468
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,940
 of losing the whole country.

469
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,200
 So the situation is quite dire.

470
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,220
 And if anyone knows Marjorie Taylor Greene,

471
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,300
 I would encourage you to delete her from your contact list.

472
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,439
 'Cause she's the one, a single individual is blocking

473
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,200
 the provision of some number of billions of dollars

474
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,920
 to save an important democracy.

475
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,640
 - I wanna switch to a little bit of a philosophical question.

476
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,300
 So there was an article that you and Henry Kissinger

477
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,020
 and Dan Huttenlocher wrote last year

478
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,940
 about the nature of knowledge and how it's evolving.

479
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,920
 I had a discussion the other night about this as well.

480
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
 So for most of history,

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,720
 humans sort of had a mystical understanding of the universe,

482
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,680
 and then there's the scientific revolution

483
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,900
 and the enlightenment.

484
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,740
 And in your article, you argue that now these models are

485
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:10,540
 becoming so complicated and difficult to understand that we

486
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,120
 don't really know what's going on in them.

487
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,340
 I'll take a quote from Richard Feynman.

488
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,040
 He says, "What I cannot create, I do not understand."

489
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
 I saw this quote the other day.

490
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,280
 But now people are creating things that they can create,

491
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,940
 but they don't really understand what's inside of them.

492
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,840
 Is the nature of knowledge changing in a way?

493
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,620
 Are we going to have to start just taking

494
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,239
 the word for these models without them

495
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,020
 being able to explain it to us?

496
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,160
 - The analogy I would offer is to teenagers.

497
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,280
 If you have a teenager, you know they're human,

498
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,020
 but you can't quite figure out what they're thinking.

499
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,140
 (laughing)

500
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,540
 But somehow we've managed in society

501
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,780
 to adapt to the presence of teenagers, right?

502
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,020
 And they eventually grow out of it.

503
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,980
 And I'm just serious.

504
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,960
 So it's probably the case that we're gonna have

505
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,260
 knowledge systems that we cannot fully characterize,

506
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,540
 but we understand their boundaries, right?

507
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,700
 we understand the limits of what they can do.

508
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,540
 And that's probably the best outcome we can get.

509
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,740
 - Do you think we'll understand the limits?

510
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,360
 - We'll get pretty good at it.

511
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,440
 The consensus of my group that meets on every week

512
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,340
 is that eventually the way you'll do this,

513
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,140
 so-called adversarial AI, is that there will actually

514
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,880
 be companies that you will hire and pay money to

515
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,940
 to break your AI system.

516
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,560
 - Like red team.

517
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
 - So it'll be the red, instead of human red teams,

518
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,000
 which is what they do today, you'll have whole companies

519
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,980
 and a whole industry of AI systems whose jobs are to break

520
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,360
 the existing AI systems and find their vulnerabilities,

521
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,400
 especially the knowledge that they have

522
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,580
 that we can't figure out.

523
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,100
 That makes sense to me.

524
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,760
 It's also a great project for you here at Stanford

525
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,920
 because if you have a graduate student who has to figure out

526
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,220
 how to attack one of these large models

527
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,020
 and understand what it does, that is a great skill

528
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,260
 to build the next generation.

529
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,680
 It makes sense to me that the two will travel together.

530
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,920
 - All right, let's take some questions from the student.

531
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,900
 There's one right there in the back.

532
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,400
 Just say your name.

533
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,240
 - Earlier you mentioned, and this is related to this comment

534
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,300
 right now, getting AI that actually does what you want.

535
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,540
 You just mentioned adversarial AI, and I'm wondering if you

536
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,600
 could elaborate on that more.

537
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,140
 So it seems to be, besides obviously compute will increase,

538
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,420
 and we can get more performance models, but is getting them

539
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,120
 to do what you want an issue?

540
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,360
 Seems partially unanswered in my view.

541
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,200
 - Well, you have to assume that the current hallucination

542
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,600
 problems become less, right?

543
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
 As the technology gets better and so forth.

544
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,320
 I'm not suggesting it goes away.

545
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,820
 And then you also have to assume that there are tests

546
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,640
 for efficacy.

547
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,780
 So there has to be a way of knowing

548
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,740
 that the thing succeeded.

549
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,920
 So in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor,

550
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
 and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally

551
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
 steal everybody's music.

552
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,220
 What you would do if you're a Silicon Valley entrepreneur,

553
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,900
 which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off,

554
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
 then you'd hire a whole bunch of lawyers

555
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,620
 to go clean the mess up.

556
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,420
 Right?

557
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,680
 But if nobody uses your product,

558
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,980
 it doesn't matter that you stole all the content.

559
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,340
 And do not quote me.

560
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,020
 Right?

561
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:03,720
 (audience laughing)

562
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
 - Right, you're on camera.

563
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,000
 - Yeah, that's right.

564
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,520
 (audience laughing)

565
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,180
 But you see my point.

566
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,780
 In other words, Silicon Valley will run these tests

567
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,860
 and clean up the mess.

568
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,920
 And that's typically how those things are done.

569
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,240
 So my own view is that you'll see more and more

570
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,439
 performative systems with even better tests

571
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,860
 and eventually adversarial tests,

572
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,680
 and that'll keep it within a box.

573
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,600
 The technical term is called chain of thought reasoning.

574
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
 And people believe that in the next few years,

575
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,520
 you'll be able to generate 1,000 steps

576
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,540
 of chain of thought reasoning.

577
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,400
 Do this, do this.

578
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,660
 It's like building recipes.

579
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,680
 That the recipes, you can run the recipe,

580
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,460
 and you can actually test that it produced

581
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,560
 the correct outcome.

582
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,400
 And that's how the system will work.

583
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:45,720
 Yes, sir?

584
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,800
- in general, you seem super positive about the potential for AI's progress.

585
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,280
 I'm curious, like, what do you think is going to drive that?

586
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,680
 Is it just more compute?

587
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,540
 Is it more data?

588
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,100
 Is it fundamental or actual shifts?

589
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,820
 Yes.

590
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,160
 The amounts of money being thrown around are mind-boggling.

591
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,060
And I've chosen, 

592
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,540
I essentially invest in everything 

593
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,640
because I can't figure out 

594
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,380
who's going to win.

595
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,180
 And the amounts of money that are following me are so large,

596
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,900
I think some of it is because the early money has been made 

597
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,080
and the big money people 

598
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,260
who don't know what they're doing 

599
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,020
have to have an AI component.

600
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,820
 And everything is now an AI investment so they can't tell the difference.

601
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,480
 I define AI as learning systems, systems that actually learn.

602
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,480
 So I think it's one of them.

603
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,500
The second is that there are very sophisticated new algorithms 

604
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,440
that are sort of post-transformers.

605
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,120
My friend, my collaborator for a long time, 

606
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,520
has invented a new non-transformer architecture.

607
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,560
There's a group that I'm funding in Paris 

608
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,320
that has claims to have done the same thing.

609
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,580
 So there's enormous invention there, a lot of things at Stanford.

610
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,420
And the final thing is 

611
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,860
that there is a belief in the market 

612
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,540
that the invention of intelligence has infinite return.

613
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,900
 So let's say you put $50 billion of capital into a company.

614
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,740
 You have to make an awful lot of money from intelligence to pay that back.

615
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,620
So it's probably the case 

616
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,320
that we'll go through some huge investment bubble 

617
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,180
and then it'll sort itself out.

618
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,160
 That's always been true in the past and it's likely to be true here.

619
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
And what you said earlier was 

620
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,140
you think that the leaders 

621
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,820
are pulling away from the rest.

622
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,560
 right now.

623
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:35,180
 And this is a really, the question is roughly the following.

624
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,200
 There's a company called Mistral in France.

625
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,360
 They've done a really good job.

626
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,980
 And I'm obviously an investor.

627
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,000
 They have produced their second version.

628
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,540
 Their third model is likely to be closed because it's so expensive.

629
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,920
 They need revenue.

630
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,300
 And they can't give their model away.

631
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,280
 So this open source versus closed source debate in our industry is huge.

632
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,440
 And

633
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,700
My entire career was based on people 

634
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,640
being willing to share software 

635
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,840
in open source.

636
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,920
 Everything about me is open source.

637
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,140
 Much of Google's underpinnings were open source.

638
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,340
 Everything I've done technically.

639
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,860
And yet it may be that the capital costs, which are so immense, 

640
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,480
fundamentally changes how software is built.

641
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,560
 You and I were talking.

642
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,100
My own view of software programmers is 

643
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,820
that software programmers productivity will 

644
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,480
at least double.

645
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,660
 There are three or four software companies that are trying to do that.

646
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,800
 I've invested in all of them.

647
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,280
 In the spirit.

648
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,840
 And they're all trying to make software programmers more productive.

649
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,340
 The most interesting one that I just met with is called Augment.

650
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,140
 And I always think of an individual programmer.

651
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,320
 And they said, "That's not our target.

652
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,380
 Our target are these 100-person software programming teams

653
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,120
 on millions of lines of code

654
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
 where nobody knows what's going on."

655
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,180
 Well, that's a really good AI thing.

656
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,960
 Will they make money?

657
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:51,920
 I hope so.

658
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,440
 So a lot of questions here.

659
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:54,860
 Yes, ma'am.

660
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,400
 Perfect.

661
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:55,800
 Hi.

662
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,080
So at the very beginning, 

663
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,800
you mentioned that there's the combination of the context window expansion, 

664
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,120
the agents and the text to action is going to have unimaginable impacts.

665
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,440
 First of all, why is the combination important?

666
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,980
And second of all, I know that, you know, 

667
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,920
you're not like a crystal ball and you can't necessarily tell the future.

668
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,780
 But why do you think it's beyond anything that we could imagine?

669
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,260
 allows you to solve the problem of recency.

670
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,020
 The current models take a year to train, roughly 18 months.

671
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,280
 Six months of preparation, six months of training,

672
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,640
 six months of fine-tuning.

673
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,960
 So they're always out of date.

674
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,880
 Context window, you can feed what happened.

675
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,580
 Like, you can ask it questions about the Hamas-Israel war,

676
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,700
 right, in a context.

677
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,720
 That's very powerful.

678
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,540
 It becomes current like Google.

679
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,220
 In the case of agents, I'll give you an example.

680
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,860
 I set up a foundation, which is funding a non-profit.

681
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,040
 It starts with, there's a, I don't know if there's chemists

682
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,760
 in the room that, I don't really understand chemistry.

683
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,520
 There's a tool called ChemCrow, C-R-O-W,

684
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,140
 which was an LLM-based system that learned chemistry.

685
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,220
 And what they do is they run it to generate chemistry

686
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,080
 hypotheses about proteins, and then they have a lab

687
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,980
 which runs the tests overnight, and then it learns.

688
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,600
 That's a huge acceleration, accelerant in chemistry,

689
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,080
 material science, and so forth.

690
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,440
 So that's an agent model.

691
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,440
 And I think the text to action can be understood by just

692
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,120
 having a lot of cheap programmers, right?

693
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,640
 And I don't think we understand what happens--

694
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,940
 and this is, again, your area of expertise--

695
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,100
 what happens when everyone has their own programmer.

696
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,560
 And I'm not talking about turning on and off the lights.

697
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,220
 I imagine-- another example--

698
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,580
 for some reason, you don't like Google.

699
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,440
 So you say, build me a Google competitor.

700
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,560
 Yeah, you personally, build me a Google competitor,

701
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,840
 search the web, build a UI, make a good copy,

702
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,240
 add generative AI in an interesting way,

703
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,880
 do it in 30 seconds, and see if it works.

704
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,100
 So a lot of people believe that the incumbents, including

705
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,940
 Google, are vulnerable to this kind of an attack.

706
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,460
 Now, we'll see.

707
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,260
 There were a bunch of questions that were sent over by Slido.

708
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,520
 Some of them were upvoted.

709
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,640
 Here's one, we talked a little bit about this last year.

710
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,740
 How can we stop AI from influencing public opinion,

711
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,060
 misinformation, especially during the upcoming election?

712
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,360
 What are the short and long-term solutions from?

713
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,140
 - Most of the misinformation in this upcoming election,

714
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,880
 and globally, will be on social media.

715
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,160
 And the social media companies are not organized

716
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,420
 well enough to police it.

717
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,600
 If you look at TikTok, for example,

718
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,400
 there are lots of accusations that TikTok

719
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,200
 is favoring one kind of misinformation over another,

720
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,700
 And there are many people who claim without proof, that I'm

721
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,460
 aware of, that the Chinese are forcing them to do it.

722
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,660
 I think we have a mess here.

723
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,800
 And the country is going to have to learn critical thinking.

724
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,620
 That may be an impossible challenge for the US.

725
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,340
 But the fact that somebody told you something

726
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,560
 does not mean that it's true.

727
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
 Could it go too far the other way, that there's things that

728
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,760
 really are true and nobody believes anymore?

729
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,400
 You get some people call it a epistemological crisis,

730
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,480
 that now, you know, Elon says, no, I never did that.

731
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,320
 Prove it.

732
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,220
 - Well, let's use Donald Trump.

733
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,640
 - Okay.

734
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,860
 - Look, I think we have a trust problem in our society.

735
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,360
 Democracies can fail.

736
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,720
 And I think that the greatest threat to democracy

737
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,080
 is misinformation, because we're gonna get

738
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,200
 really good at it.

739
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,720
 When I managed YouTube, the biggest problems we had

740
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,260
 on YouTube were that people would upload false videos

741
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,780
 and people would die as a result.

742
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,820
 And we had a no death policy, shocking.

743
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,780
 And we just went, it was just horrendous

744
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,740
 to try to address this.

745
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,360
 And this is before generative AI.

746
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,080
 - Well, so-- - I don't have a good answer.

747
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,080
 - One technical, it's not an answer,

748
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,360
 but one thing that seems like it could mitigate

749
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,860
 that I don't understand why it's more widely used

750
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,640
 is public key authentication.

751
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,360
 That when Joe Biden speaks,

752
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,740
 why isn't it digitally signed like SSL is?

753
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,280
 Or when, you know, that celebrities or public figures

754
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,820
 or others, couldn't they have a public key?

755
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,060
 - Yeah, it's a form of public key,

756
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,000
 and then some form of certainty of knowing

757
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,380
 how the system can-- - Hey, when I send my

758
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,380
 credit card to Amazon, I know it's Amazon.

759
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,520
 - I wrote a paper and published it with Jonathan Haid,

760
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,180
 who's the one working on the anxiety generation stuff.

761
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,120
 It had exactly zero impact.

762
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,460
 And he's a very good communicator, I probably am not.

763
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,260
 So my conclusion was that the system is not organized

764
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,920
 what you said.

765
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,060
 You had a paper advocating what we did that.

766
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,300
 Advocating your proposal.

767
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:48,580
 Okay.

768
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,920
 My

769
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,220
 microphone.

770
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,460
 No, what you said.

771
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:50,880
 Yeah, right.

772
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,680
 And my conclusion is the CEOs in general are maximizing

773
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,100
 revenue.

774
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,760
 To maximize revenue, you maximize engagement.

775
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,740
 To maximize engagement, you maximize

776
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,320
 outrage.

777
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,920
 The algorithms choose outrage because that generates more revenue, right?

778
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,140
 Therefore,

779
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,480
 there's a bias to favor crazy stuff.

780
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,980
 And on all sides.

781
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,500
 I'm not making a partisan statement here.

782
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,260
 That's a problem.

783
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,380
 That's got to get addressed.

784
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,940
 In a democracy, and my solution to TikTok,

785
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,120
 we talked about this earlier privately, is there was when I was a boy,

786
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,740
 there was something called

787
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,660
 the equal time rule.

788
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,560
 Because TikTok is really not social media, it's really television, right?

789
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,760
 There's a programmer making you, the numbers by the way are 90 minutes a day,

790
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,300
 200 TikTok videos per

791
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,220
 TikTok user in the United States.

792
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,700
 It's a lot, right?

793
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,440
 So, and the government is not going to do

794
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,900
 to do, some form of balance that is required.

795
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,200
 All right, let's take some more questions.

796
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,560
 Two quick questions.

797
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,840
 One, economic impact of LM's, slower like labor market impacts,

798
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,040
 slower than you originally anticipated,

799
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,720
 and for the Chegg and a couple of service people in them

800
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:01,860
 too.

801
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,140
Do you think academia deserves 

802
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,940
or should get AI subsidies 

803
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,460
or do you think they should just

804
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,900
 just partner with big players out there.

805
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,060
 - I pushed really, really hard on getting data centers

806
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,800
 for universities.

807
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,400
 If I were a faculty member in the computer science department

808
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,480
 here, I would be beyond upset that I can't build

809
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,460
 the algorithms with my graduate students

810
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,460
 that will do the kind of PhD research.

811
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,840
 And I'm forced to work with these.

812
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,860
 And the companies have not, in my view,

813
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,100
 been generous enough with respect to that.

814
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,480
 The faculty members that I talk with,

815
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,120
 many of whom you know, spend lots of time waiting

816
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,960
 for their credits from Google Cloud.

817
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,760
 That's terrible.

818
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,239
 This is an explosion.

819
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,540
 We want America to win.

820
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,199
 We want American universities-- there's lots of reasons, I think,

821
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,800
 that the right thing to do is to get it to them.

822
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,800
 So I'm working hard on that.

823
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,100
 And your first question was labor market impact?

824
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,380
 I'll defer to the real expert here.

825
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,680
 As your amateur economist, taught by Eric,

826
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,040
 I fundamentally believe that the sort of college education,

827
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,720
 a high skills task will be fine,

828
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,740
 'cause people will work with these systems.

829
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,220
 I think the systems is no different

830
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,560
 from any other technology wave.

831
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,080
 The dangerous jobs and the jobs which require

832
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,400
 very little human judgment will get replaced.

833
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
 - We have about five minutes left,

834
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,860
 so let's go really quick with some questions.

835
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,120
 I'll let you pick them, Eric.

836
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,680
 - Yes, ma'am.

837
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,440
 - I'm really curious about the text to action

838
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,560
 and its impact on, for example, computer science education.

839
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,340
I'm wondering what you have thoughts on how CES education should transform, 

840
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,800
kind of meet the age.

841
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,380
Well, 

842
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,280
I'm assuming that computer scientists as a group 

843
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,500
in undergraduate school 

844
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,600
will always have a programmer buddy with them.

845
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,720
So when you learn your first for loop and so forth and so on, 

846
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,000
you'll have a tool that will be your natural partner.

847
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,680
And that's how the teaching will go on, that the professor, 

848
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,440
he or she will talk about the concepts, but you'll engage with it that way.

849
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,140
 And that's my guess.

850
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,040
 Yes, ma'am, behind you.

851
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,617
You're talking more about the non-transformer architectures that you're excited about.

852
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:18,864
I think one that's been talked about is like state models, but then now a longer context class.

853
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:23,160
I'm more so curious what you're seeing in this case.

854
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,000
 I don't understand the math well enough.

855
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,540
 This is the, I'm really pleased that we have produced jobs for mathematicians.

856
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,560
 Because the math here is so complicated.

857
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,400
But basically they are different ways of doing gradient descent, 

858
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,280
matrix multiply, faster and better.

859
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,400
And transformers as you know 

860
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,180
is a sort of systematic way 

861
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,500
of multiplying at the same time.

862
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,780
 That's the way I think about it.

863
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,180
 And it's similar to that.

864
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,980
 But different math.

865
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,020
 Let's see, over here, yes sir.

866
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,380
 Go ahead.

867
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,200
 - Yeah, you.

868
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,500
 - Yeah.

869
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,560
 You mentioned in your paper on national security,

870
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,966
 as you have China and the US, and the help of modern architectures today.

871
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:03,000
The next 10, and then that's clustered

872
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,320
 down are all other US allies, or teed up nicely

873
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,300
 to the US allies.

874
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,760
 I'm curious what your take is on those 10,

875
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,160
 they're sort of like the middle, they aren't formally allies.

876
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,280
 What is stuff, how likely are they to get on board

877
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,780
 with securing our superiority a lot,

878
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,320
 and what would hold them back from wanting to get on board?

879
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,520
 - The most interesting country is India,

880
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,420
 because the top AI people come from India to the US,

881
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,700
 and we should let India keep some of its top talent.

882
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,200
 Not all of them, but some of them.

883
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,380
 And they don't have the kind of training facilities

884
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
 and programs that we so richly have here.

885
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,200
 To me, India is the big swing state in that regard.

886
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,700
 China's lost, it's not gonna come back.

887
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,300
 They're not going to change the regime as much as people wish them to do.

888
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,380
 Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp.

889
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,580
 Taiwan is a fantastic country whose software is terrible,

890
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,620
 so that's not going to work.

891
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,440
 Amazing hardware.

892
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,780
And in the rest of the world, 

893
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,900
there are not a lot of other good choices that are big.

894
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,300
 Europe has screwed up because of Brussels.

895
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,640
 It's not a new fact.

896
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,120
 I spent 10 years fighting them.

897
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,340
 And I worked really hard to get them to fix the EU Act.

898
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,120
 And they still have all the restrictions

899
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,540
 that make it very difficult to do our kind of research

900
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:23,940
 in Europe.

901
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,480
 My French friends have spent all their time battling Brussels.

902
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,540
 And Macron, who's a personal friend,

903
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,820
 is fighting hard for this.

904
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,260
 And so France, I think, has a chance.

905
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
 I don't see Germany coming.

906
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,280
 And the rest is not big enough.

907
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,240
 Go ahead.

908
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:38,700
 Yes, ma'am.

909
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,440
 So I'm an engineer by training in a compiler.

910
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,260
 Given the capabilities that you envision these models having,

911
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,220
 should we still spend time learning to code?

912
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,260
 Yeah, because ultimately, it's the old thing of,

913
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,380
 why do you study English if you can speak English?

914
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:56,940
 You get better at it.

915
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,040
 You really do need to understand how these systems work.

916
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,340
 And I feel very strongly-- yes, sir?

917
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,400
 Yeah, I'm curious if you've explored the distributed

918
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:05,740
 setting.

919
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,040
 And I'm asking because, sure, making a large cluster

920
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,720
 is difficult, but MacBooks are powerful.

921
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,820
 There's a lot of small machines across the world.

922
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,240
 So do you think folding at home or a similar idea

923
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,580
 works for training?

924
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,040
 - Yeah.

925
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,980
 Yeah, we've looked very hard at this.

926
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,620
 So the way the algorithms work is you have

927
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,200
 a very large matrix and you have essentially

928
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,380
 a multiplication function.

929
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,560
 So think of it as going back and forth and back and forth.

930
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,180
 And these systems are completely limited

931
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,280
 by the speed of memory to CPU or GPU.

932
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,960
 And in fact, the next iteration of Nvidia chips

933
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,200
 has combined all those functions into one chip.

934
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,220
 The chips are now so big that they glue them all together.

935
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,460
 And in fact, the package is so sensitive,

936
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,700
 the package is put together in a clean room

937
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,780
 as well as the chip itself.

938
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,620
 So the answer looks like supercomputers and speed of light,

939
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,340
 especially memory interconnect, really dominated.

940
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,040
 So I think unlikely for a while.

941
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,040
 - Is there a way to segment the LLM?

942
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,320
 So Jeff Dean, last year when he spoke here,

943
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,160
 talked about having these different parts of it

944
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,220
 that you would train separately,

945
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,940
 and then kind of federate them.

946
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,860
 - Each, in order to do that,

947
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,620
 you'd have to have 10 million such things,

948
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,900
 and then the way you would ask the questions

949
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,660
 would be too slow.

950
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,460
 He's talking about eight or 10 or 12.

951
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:22,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
 So not down to the level of my--

953
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,580
 - Not at his level.

954
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,220
 - Yeah, all right.

955
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,820
 - Is he in the back?

956
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,440
 Yes, way back.

957
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,380
 - I know, like, after ChatGPT

958
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,800
 was released

959
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,380
 in the New York Times, sued OpenAI for using their works

960
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,900
 for training.

961
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,220
 Where do you think that's gonna go,

962
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,400
 and what that means for data privacy?

963
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,340
 - I used to do a lot of work on the music licensing stuff,

964
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,200
 What I learned was that in the 60s,

965
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,300
 there was a series of lawsuits that resulted in an agreement where you get a

966
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,220
 stipulated royalty whenever your song is played.

967
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,640
 Even, even, they don't even know who you are.

968
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,720
 It's just paid into a bank.

969
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,600
 And my guess is it'll be the same thing.

970
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,560
 There'll be lots of lawsuits and there'll be some kind of stipulated agreement,

971
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,640
which will just say you have to pay X percent 

972
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,600
of whatever revenue you have 

973
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,560
in order to use the ASCAP EMI.

974
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,120
 and ask ASCAP BMI, look them up, it's a long,

975
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,540
 it will seem very old to you,

976
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,020
 but I think that's how it will ultimately.

977
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:11,720
 Yes, sir.

978
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,460
 - It seems like there's a few players that are dominating AI

979
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,860
 right, and they'll continue to dominate,

980
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,140
 and they seem to overlap with the large companies

981
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,460
 that all the antitrust regulation is kind of focused on.

982
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,980
 How do you see those two trends kind of, yeah,

983
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,280
 like do you see regulators breaking up these companies

984
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,240
 and how will that affect the, yeah.

985
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,680
 So in my career, I helped Microsoft get broken up,

986
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,720
 and it wasn't broken up.

987
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,120
 And I fought for Google to not be broken up,

988
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,240
 and it's not been broken up.

989
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,420
 So it sure looks to me like the trend is not to be broken up.

990
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,720
 As long as the companies avoid being John D.

991
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,240
 Rockefeller

992
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,760
 the senior-- and I studied this, look it up.

993
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,100
 It's how antitrust law came.

994
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,880
 I don't think the governments will act.

995
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,500
 The reason you're seeing these large companies dominate

996
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,880
 is who has the capital to build these data centers?

997
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,060
 So my friend Reed and my friend Mustafa--

998
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,200
 - He's coming next week, two weeks from now.

999
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,980
 - Have Reed talk to you about the decision that they made

1000
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,000
 to take inflection and essentially piece part it

1001
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,640
 into Microsoft.

1002
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,980
 Basically they decided they couldn't raise

1003
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,160
 the tens of billions of dollars.

1004
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,800
 - Is that number public that you mentioned earlier?

1005
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,060
 - No.

1006
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:23,480
 - Okay.

1007
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,840
 - Have Reed give you the number.

1008
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,380
 - Okay, maybe Reed can say it.

1009
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,500
 I know you gotta go, I don't wanna hold you up.

1010
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,300
 I wanna leave you with-- - Wait, wait, wait.

1011
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,460
 Do we do one-- this gentleman-- one more.

1012
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,120
 I have a question for you.

1013
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:31,300
 One more.

1014
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,660
 Yeah, go ahead.

1015
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,380
 Thank you so much.

1016
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,440
 [LAUGHTER]

1017
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,140
 Thank you so much.

1018
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,600
 I'll make it quick.

1019
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,920
 I was wondering where all of this

1020
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,200
 is going to leave countries who are non-participants

1021
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,620
 in development of frontier models and access to compute,

1022
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,100
 for example.

1023
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,300
 The rich get richer, and the poor do the best they can.

1024
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,260
 They'll have to-- the fact of the matter

1025
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,860
 is this is a rich countries game, right?

1026
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,200
 Huge capital, lots of technically strong people,

1027
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,520
 strong government support, right?

1028
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,980
 There are two examples.

1029
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,560
 There are lots of other countries

1030
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,640
 that have all sorts of problems.

1031
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,680
 They don't have those resources.

1032
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,300
 They'll have to find a partner.

1033
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,260
 They'll have to join with somebody else,

1034
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,940
 something like that.

1035
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,160
 - I wanna leave it, 'cause I think the last time we met,

1036
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,780
 you were at a hackathon at AGI House,

1037
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,700
 and I know you spent a lot of time helping young people

1038
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,620
 as they create a lot of wealth,

1039
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,800
 and you spoke very passionately about wanting to do that.

1040
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,740
 Do you have any advice for folks here

1041
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,980
 as they're building their,

1042
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,940
 they're writing their business plans for this class,

1043
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,080
 or policy proposals or research proposals, you know,

1044
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,960
 at this stage of the careers going

1045
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:32,260
 forward?

1046
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,700
Well, I teach a class in the business school on this, 

1047
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,160
so you should come to my class.

1048
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:46,920
  I am struck by the speed with which you can build demonstrations of new ideas.

1049
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,320
 So in one

1050
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,240
 of the hackathons I did, the winning team, the command was,

1051
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,712
 "Fly the drone between two towers, 

1052
00:43:55,712 --> 00:43:57,400
and it was given a virtual drone space.

1053
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,740
 And it figured out how to fly the drone,

1054
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,520
 what the word between meant, generated the code in Python,

1055
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,660
 and flew the drone in the simulator through the tower.

1056
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,860
 I just, it would have taken a week or two,

1057
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
 from good professional programmers to do that.

1058
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,180
 I'm telling you that the ability to prototype quickly,

1059
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,320
 really, part of the problem with being an entrepreneur

1060
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,580
 is everything happens faster.

1061
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,940
 Well now, if you can't get your prototype built

1062
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,140
 using these various tools, you need to think about that.

1063
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,640
 Because that's who your competitor

1064
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,080
 is doing.

1065
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,640
 So I guess my biggest advice is when you start thinking about a company, it's

1066
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,900
 fine to write a business plan.

1067
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,840
 In fact, you should ask the computer to write your business

1068
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,840
 plan for you.

1069
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,560
 As long as it's legal.

1070
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,320
 I should talk about that after you leave this.

1071
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,300
 But

1072
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,660
 I think it's very important

1073
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,480
 to prototype your idea using these tools

1074
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,060
 as quickly as you can,

1075
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,760
you can be sure there's another person doing exactly that same thing 

1076
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,980
in another company, 

1077
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,240
in another university, 

1078
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,060
in a place that you've never been.

1079
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,000
 All right.

1080
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,040
 Well, thank you all.

1081
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:05,760
 I'm going to rush off.

1082
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,660
 Thank you.

1083
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,460
 Thank you.

1084
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,760
So actually, let me pick up on that very last point, 

1085
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,280
because I don't think I talked about in the first class about using LLMs, 

1086
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,300
which is a welcome in this class for the assignments.

1087
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,420
 But it has to be

1088
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,900
 get to get full disclosure.

1089
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,420
So when you use them, 

1090
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,640
whether it's for the weekly assignments or for the final project or whatever, 

1091
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,040
just like you would if you asked your friendly uncle 

1092
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,680
or classmate 

1093
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,560
or anybody else to give you advice, 

1094
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,200
you should do that.

1095
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,100
 Or if you have notes that you include in there.

1096
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,480
So what I thought I'd do is 

1097
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,220
I want to talk a little bit about AI's GPT 

1098
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,460
and what that means in terms of business and implications.

1099
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,780
 But before we do that,

1100
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,160
 I just want to see if there are any questions you want to pick

1101
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,200
 up on things that Eric brought up

1102
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,460
 that I'll try and channel some of his thoughts

1103
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,160
 and we

1104
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,380
 can talk about the things that came up and then we can move on.

1105
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:05,980
 Yeah, go ahead.

1106
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,440
 One of the questions I want to ask is in relation to regulation,

1107
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,160
 if the goal is to maintain

1108
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,600
 supremacy, how do you create the right incentives so that everyone,

1109
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,080
 allies and non-allies, are

1110
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,680
 motivated to follow it?

1111
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,600
 You mean among companies that are competing with each other?

1112
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,300
 Companies or in countries?

1113
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:21,840
 Countries.

1114
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,660
And it doesn't just become sort of a ham 

1115
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,740
or obstruct kind of development for the ones 

1116
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,200
that follow the, 

1117
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,100
choose the following regulations.

1118
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,860
 It's super tricky.

1119
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,680
It's, you know, there's a book, 

1120
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,280
Co-Opetition that Barry J. Nalebuff wrote about this 

1121
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,480
because there are definitely places 

1122
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,160
where regulation can help companies 

1123
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,040
and help an industry survive.

1124
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,180
 So regulation doesn't necessarily slow things.

1125
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,080
 I mean, standards are a good example.

1126
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:53,600
 And having that clarified can make it easier for companies to compete.

1127
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,300
 So I've talked to a lot of the executives of these companies,

1128
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,300
 and there are places where

1129
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,180
 they wish there were some comma standards.

1130
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,560
And sometimes there's a bit of a race to the bottom 

1131
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,420
as well in some of the dangerous things.

1132
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,420
 One of the other reasons

1133
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,980
 that the folks at Google say

1134
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,040
 that they didn't move as fast is

1135
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,020
they felt like these LMs could be misused or dangerous, 

1136
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,120
but their hand was sort of forced.

1137
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,280
 And I was talking to some folks at one of the other big companies,

1138
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,320
 and they said, "We

1139
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,740
 weren't going to release this feature, but now competitors are doing it,

1140
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,480
 so we're going

1141
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,600
 to have to release it as well."

1142
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,140
 So this is where regulation,

1143
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,660
 there might be some interest in coordinating on regulation,

1144
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,080
but it's also, obviously, 

1145
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,740
the more obvious thing is that it is used to hinder competition.

1146
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,380
 And a lot of people, for instance,

1147
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,739
 think that the reasons that some of the big companies

1148
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,320
are very opposed to some open source 

1149
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,720
and making things more widely open source, 

1150
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,660
is they want to slow down competitors.

1151
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,460
 So there's both of those things going on.

1152
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,200
 Yeah, quick question over there.

1153
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,400
 Yep.

1154
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,800
 I just want to follow up on a comment about should we still learn to code?

1155
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,420
 Should we still study English?

1156
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,320
 Are those going to be useful?

1157
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,600
And Eric's reply, yes, like college educated, 

1158
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,840
high skilled jobs or tasks are still going to be safe, 

1159
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,360
but everything else that's in a parking management might not be.

1160
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,840
 That's kind of like intentional.

1161
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,320
I think we could talk, maybe we'll talk some more about that in a few minutes, 

1162
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,980
but it is interesting to think about 

1163
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,980
where the AI system serves just replace what people are doing 

1164
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,700
versus they complement them.

1165
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,860
And in coding right now, 

1166
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,680
it appears that they're not actually that helpful for the really best coders.

1167
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,100
 They're very helpful for moderately good coders.

1168
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,900
 But if you don't know anything at all about coding, they're not helpful either.

1169
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,720
 So it's kind of an inverted U.

1170
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:43,100
And you can see why that would be the case, 

1171
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,040
that if you don't even understand the code 

1172
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,560
that they generate right now 

1173
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,420
is often buggy 

1174
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,480
or isn't exactly right.

1175
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,420
So if you can't even interpret it, understand what's going on, 

1176
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,680
you can't use it very effectively.

1177
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,120
And for now, the very best coders, 

1178
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,780
it appears that the code that is generated just isn't at that level, 

1179
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,980
so you get that new shape.

1180
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,640
But that means if you are sort of, don't know any code, 

1181
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,520
you do need to have some in order for it to be useful.

1182
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,860
 And I think that's true for a lot of applications right now,

1183
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,820
 that you have to have some basic understanding in order to get the most of it.

1184
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,300
 I think it's an interesting open question,

1185
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,520
 if that's sort of always going to be the case.

1186
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,120
 I put up at the last class very briefly

1187
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:31,380
 this slide that had level 0 through 5 autonomous cars.

1188
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,740
 And one of the things that actually we can talk about now,

1189
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,540
 So, what I'm trying to sort through is,

1190
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,860
 what if you took that paradigm and you applied

1191
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,800
 it to all tasks in the economy?

1192
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,980
 How many would they go through?

1193
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,720
 So, with autonomous cars, we aren't really at level five very much.

1194
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,260
Although, I don't know how many of you guys have ridden in a Waymo, 

1195
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,580
one of the Waymo cars.

1196
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,580
 So, that one seems pretty good, although Sebastian Thrun,

1197
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,380
 who I rode in it with, says it's just

1198
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,880
 incredibly expensive right now.

1199
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,020
 They probably lose $50 to $100.

1200
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,780
 He doesn't know.

1201
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,140
 He's not there.

1202
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,420
 He started the program, but he's not there anymore.

1203
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,480
 But just all of the cost of running it, it's not practical.

1204
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,880
 Maybe it'll get down the curve, LIDAR will get cheaper, et cetera.

1205
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:21,000
 But we have a lot of autonomous cars at level 2, 3, even 4, arguably,

1206
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,440
 where humans are still involved.

1207
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,520
 And you see a lot of other tasks, like coding.

1208
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,360
 I just talked about that.

1209
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,060
 On the other hand, chess, that slide, or the slide before it,

1210
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,940
 I talked about what's sometimes called advanced chess or freestyle chess.

1211
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,500
 When Gary Kasparov, after he lost to Deep Blue in 1998, '97,

1212
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,660
 he started this set of

1213
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,000
 competitions where humans and machines could work together.

1214
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,700
 And for a long time, when I gave my TED talk, it was true,

1215
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,200
 my TED talk in 2012, 2013, it

1216
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,140
 It was true at that time that a human working with a machine

1217
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,820
 could beat Deep Blue or any chess computer.

1218
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,720
 And so the very best chess-playing entities

1219
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,700
 were these combinations.

1220
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,040
 That's not true anymore.

1221
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,140
 AlphaZero and other programs like that, they would have--

1222
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,820
 they would get nothing from a human contributing.

1223
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,880
 It would just be like kind of an annoyance to the chess machine.

1224
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,900
 So that went through level zero, machines not being able to do

1225
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,300
 anything, through a period where they work together,

1226
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,740
 to a period where it's fully autonomous in a span of,

1227
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,500
 I don't know, 20 years or so.

1228
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,700
 It would be interesting, if anybody wants to work on a

1229
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,620
 research project, or if any of you guys have thoughts right

1230
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,420
 now, what are the criteria for which kinds of tasks

1231
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,940
 in the economy will be in that middle zone?

1232
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,940
 Because that middle zone is kind of a nice one for us humans,

1233
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,440
 where the machines are helping us,

1234
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,680
 but humans are still indispensable to creating value.

1235
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,400
 And that's a zone where you can have higher productivity, more

1236
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,420
 wealth and performance, but also more likely to have shared

1237
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,680
 prosperity because labor is sort of inherently distributed,

1238
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,480
 whereas technology and capital, as Eric was just saying,

1239
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,880
 potentially could be very concentrated.

1240
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,820
 Do you have a thought on that?

1241
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,260
 I was just going to ask a related question.

1242
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,620
 He was saying also that we have a 10-year chip manufacturing.

1243
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,120
 - Yeah, I was surprised about that.

1244
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,720
 - Yeah, and I think what was interesting to me

1245
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,940
 as a labor economist is that it was really a green flag

1246
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,660
 I've seen in literature and news that,

1247
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,860
 okay, if we're onshoring all of this chip manufacturing,

1248
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,040
 isn't that going to create some sort of resurgence

1249
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,440
 in blue-collar jobs?

1250
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,140
 And I wondered if you had any thoughts about

1251
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,680
 intelligent robotic models or human labor--

1252
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,560
 - Well, I don't think it's gonna be much of a, I mean,

1253
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,360
 - I'm gonna put you guys in a visitor-ship fab, anybody?

1254
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,820
 You guys, I'm a few of you have.

1255
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,940
 How many workers were in that fab?

1256
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,460
 - What was it, TSMC, the NYU go in, so I don't know.

1257
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,360
 - Yeah, I mean, well, okay, so the answer's zero.

1258
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,100
 Like, the reason that they don't let you,

1259
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,300
 they don't let anyone go in,

1260
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,740
 because we humans are too clumsy and dirty,

1261
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,580
 and we can't, so it's all robotic.

1262
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,560
 It's sealed inside, so there is work to, you know,

1263
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,220
 bring stuff to them, et cetera.

1264
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,140
 And if a robot like falls over or something goes

1265
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,740
 wrong, they have to put on, you've probably seen these like, they look like

1266
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,400
 spacesuits.

1267
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,520
 You know, they have to go in and then they kind of maybe adjust

1268
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,520
 something and then they go back out and hope they didn't break anything.

1269
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,400
 That's,

1270
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,840
 so it's basically lights out.

1271
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,140
 Yeah, I don't think it's, there are some, there is

1272
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,760
 some like more sophisticated labor required that, I don't think it's

1273
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,180
 like a blue-collar research.

1274
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,480
 In fact,

1275
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,160
one of the reasons 

1276
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,220
that Apple reshored MacBook production to Texas 

1277
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,200
is not because

1278
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,060
 labor is so cheap in Texas or anything.

1279
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,900
 It's that they don't actually require a whole lot of labor anymore.

1280
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,360
 So it's a pretty labor-like thing.

1281
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,280
 US manufacturing is surging in terms of output, but in terms of employment,

1282
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,360
 it's not really

1283
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,920
 growing all that much.

1284
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,340
 Let's go over here.

1285
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:13,540
 Yeah.

1286
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,220
Do you see an inflection point coming 

1287
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,360
for AI agents 

1288
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,620
or text to action models 

1289
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,160
in the next year?

1290
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:20,600
 Oh yeah.

1291
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:20,960
 No, no.

1292
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,480
 What he said, what Eric, I'm hearing similar things.

1293
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,360
 Actually, he had a really nice way of putting those three trends.

1294
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,680
I've heard about them all separately, 

1295
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
but I think it was good to bring them all together.

1296
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,960
Earlier today, I was talking to Andrew Eng, 

1297
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,500
and he's like been beating this drum 

1298
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,080
about agents in particular 

1299
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,740
as being sort of the wave of 2024, 

1300
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,320
where Andrew had a nice way of describing it.

1301
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,180
 that like as you guys know, if you have an LLM, I don't know,

1302
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,540
 write an essay or something like that.

1303
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,180
It writes it one word at a time 

1304
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,980
and it just goes through in one pass 

1305
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,340
and writes the essay.

1306
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,340
 It's pretty good.

1307
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,480
 But imagine if you had to do that,

1308
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,120
 like no backspace, no chance to let you know,

1309
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,640
 you don't make an outline first,

1310
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,500
 you just go through.

1311
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,480
 The agents now will say, "Okay.

1312
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,160
 First make an outline.

1313
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,600
That's the first step you do 

1314
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,260
when you write an essay 

1315
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,880
and then fill in each paragraph.

1316
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,940
 Then go back and see if the flow is right.

1317
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,500
 Now go back and check the voice.

1318
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,500
 Is this the right level for our audience?

1319
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,580
 Now, and by iterating like that,

1320
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,480
 you can write a much, much better essay

1321
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,520
 or any kind of a task.

1322
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,080
 This is a real revolution.

1323
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,320
 There's all sorts of things you can just do much better

1324
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,380
 if you do that.

1325
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,820
 Then the thing about the context windows

1326
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,740
 is also really important.

1327
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,700
 So I'm just gonna quote smart people that I know.

1328
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,080
 Eric Horvitz, I was on a panel with him at the GSB.

1329
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,460
 Some of you may have been there, it's the last week.

1330
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,140
 And he had this nice taxonomy.

1331
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,920
 People were asking him about fine tuning.

1332
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,820
 I think Susan was asking him about fine tuning.

1333
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,500
 And he said, well, there's really three ways

1334
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,840
 that you can take a model and have it more customized.

1335
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,580
 One is you can fine tune it,

1336
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,140
 which basically like train it some more.

1337
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,900
 Another is with larger and larger context windows.

1338
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,040
 And the third is with RAG or techniques like that,

1339
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,620
 that are retrieval augmented generation,

1340
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,980
 where it goes and accesses external data.

1341
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,420
 But these context windows seem to be remarkably effective now.

1342
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,040
 I guess, as Eric was saying, we thought it was hard.

1343
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,080
 Maybe Peter can explain.

1344
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,740
 But for some reason, we're able to make much, much bigger ones.

1345
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,960
 And now, you can load a whole book or a whole set of books.

1346
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,980
 You can load all sorts of informations in there.

1347
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,960
 And that can give you all of the context around.

1348
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,060
 So that's a pretty big revolution.

1349
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:37,540
 It's why it opens up a bunch of capabilities that we just didn't have before,

1350
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,900
 including having things much more current as Eric was saying.

1351
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,160
 Did you want to follow up on that?

1352
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,720
 [inaudible]

1353
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
 That's a good question.

1354
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,340
I mean, there's certainly a lot more capital going in, 

1355
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,680
but that kind of begs the questions and comments.

1356
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,020
 Why is all this capital going there as opposed to somewhere else?

1357
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,660
And I think, you know, if you look at the arc of history, 

1358
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,120
sometimes it looks kind of smooth, but if you look more closely, 

1359
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,260
there's a lot of jumps.

1360
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,220
 There are certain big inventions and smaller inventions.

1361
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,200
 And Andrew Karpathy was saying that he was playing around with physics,

1362
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,280
 and to really

1363
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,980
 make progress in physics, to be a top physicist,

1364
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,160
 you have to be incredibly smart, study a whole

1365
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,620
 lot, and maybe if you're lucky,

1366
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,500
 you could make some small incremental contribution,

1367
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,340
 and some people do.

1368
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,060
 But he says that right now in AI and machine learning,

1369
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,260
 we seem to be in an era where there's

1370
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,320
 just a lot of low-hanging fruit, that there have been some breakthroughs.

1371
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:40,320
 And instead of exhausting the space, like picking all the food off of a tree,

1372
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,320
 it's more

1373
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,279
 like combinatorics.

1374
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,440
 In the second machine age, they talk about building blocks.

1375
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,540
When you put two building blocks together, or Lego blocks, 

1376
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
you can make more and more.

1377
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,620
 Right now, we seem to be in an era where there's just a lot of opportunity,

1378
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,440
 and people are

1379
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,420
 recognizing that.

1380
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,060
 And one discovery begets another discovery, begets another opportunity.

1381
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:08,060
 And because of that, it attracts the investment and more people are involved.

1382
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,680
 And in economics, sometimes when more resources go in,

1383
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,360
 you get diminishing returns, like in,

1384
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,760
 I don't know, in agriculture or in mining.

1385
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,920
 Other places, there's increasing returns.

1386
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,860
 And more engineers coming to Silicon Valley

1387
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,980
 makes the existing engineers more valuable,

1388
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,860
 not less valuable.

1389
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,960
 So we seem to be in an era where that's happening.

1390
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,060
 And then the flywheel of the additional investment,

1391
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,100
 the additional dollars for training, all of

1392
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,480
 that makes them more and more powerful.

1393
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,640
 I don't know how long this will continue,

1394
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,340
 but it just seems that there are some technologies

1395
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,360
that have hit this really fertile period 

1396
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,520
and there's positive feedback 

1397
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,540
that ends up helping.

1398
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,120
 We seem to be in one of those right now.

1399
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,700
 So people who are trained in getting in the field

1400
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,420
 are making contributions that are often quite significant

1401
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,740
 in a faster time than they might have in some other fields.

1402
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,380
 Encouraging all of you guys, I think,

1403
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,540
 are doing the right thing right now.

1404
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,260
 Yeah.

1405
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,580
 Let's take a couple more questions, and then-- yeah.

1406
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,340
 OK, how about over here?

1407
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,060
 So not everyone can sit in a room

1408
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,280
 and have all these discussions and debates around AI.

1409
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,060
 And so I'd like to get your thoughts on AI literacy

1410
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,839
 for non-technical stakeholders, whether they're policy makers

1411
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,860
 would have to make it in some way of judgment,

1412
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,820
 or the general public like music tech.

1413
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,740
 How do you think about explaining technical basics

1414
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,100
 versus discussing abstract implications that don't necessarily

1415
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,740
 have a right answer?

1416
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,680
 - Well, that's a hard one.

1417
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,360
 I have to say, there's been a sea change recently

1418
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,740
 in terms of how much people in Congress and elsewhere

1419
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,760
 are paying more attention to this topic.

1420
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,320
 It used to be not something that they were interested in.

1421
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,820
 Now everyone's trying to understand it a little bit better.

1422
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,820
 And I think that there are a lot of margins

1423
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,960
 can make contributions.

1424
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,980
 They can make contributions in the technical side, but

1425
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:05,700
 if anything, I mean my bet is that the business and economic side is where the

1426
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,280
 bigger bottleneck is right now.

1427
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,360
 That, you know, even if you know if you made

1428
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,700
 enormous contributions on the technology side, you still there's still a gap

1429
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,260
 converting that into something that will change policy.

1430
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,910
 So understand if you're  into political science or a politician, 

1431
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:21,860
understanding what are the implications

1432
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,680
 for democracy and for misinformation and power and concentration.

1433
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,460
 Those are things that are

1434
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,980
 not well understood at all.

1435
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,640
 I don't know that a computer scientist is necessarily the right

1436
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,040
 person to try to understand that,

1437
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,940
 but understanding enough about the technologies, you know what

1438
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,160
 might be possible, and then thinking through what are the dynamics,

1439
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,240
 like Henry Kissinger

1440
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,780
 was doing with Eric Schmidt in his book.

1441
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,200
 If you're an economist, thinking through the

1442
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,000
 labor market implications, the implications for concentration,

1443
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,200
 the implications for inequality,

1444
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,840
 jobs, the implications for productivity and what drives productivity.

1445
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:54,640
 Those are

1446
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,320
 things that are very ripe right now.

1447
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,140
 And you could go through lots of different

1448
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,580
 fields where there's, you know, understanding well enough what the

1449
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,680
 technology might be capable of, but then thinking through the implications.

1450
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:06,580
 That's

1451
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,400
 I think where some of the biggest payoffs are.

1452
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,740
 I mean, let me give you a little bit

1453
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,140
 more of a concrete example,

1454
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,920
 and this is something I was going to talk about last

1455
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,260
 week.

1456
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,860
 Electricity was also a general purpose technology and general purpose

1457
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,820
 technologies have this characteristic that they're probably in and of

1458
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,660
 themselves but one of the real powers of general purpose technologies,

1459
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,520
 GPTs as I

1460
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:36,140
 was saying, is that they give complementary, they ignite complementary

1461
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:36,680
 innovations.

1462
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,839
 So you know electricity, you know light bulbs and computers and

1463
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,660
electric motors, and electric motors give you compressors, and refrigerators, 

1464
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,480
and air conditioning.

1465
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,560
You can just kind of have a whole set, 

1466
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,440
a cascade of additional innovations from this one innovation.

1467
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,320
 And most of the value comes from these complementary innovations.

1468
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,280
One thing people don't appreciate enough 

1469
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,840
is that some of the most important complementary innovations 

1470
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,100
are organizational and human capital complementarities.

1471
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:09,320
So with electricity, when they first introduced electricity into factories, 

1472
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,820
Paul Davis, who is a professor at the University of Michigan,

1473
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,000
of it here at Stanford 

1474
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,740
studied what happened to those factories 

1475
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,380
and surprisingly not much.

1476
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,900
 The factories when they started electrifying

1477
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,000
 they were not significantly more productive

1478
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,660
 than the previous factories that were powered by steam engines.

1479
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,800
 He's like well that's kind

1480
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,580
 of weird because this is it seems like a pretty important technology.

1481
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,440
 Is it just a fad?

1482
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,000
 Obviously

1483
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:30,300
 not.

1484
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,200
 The factories before electricity were powered by steam engines.

1485
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:34,740
 They typically had

1486
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,820
 a big steam engine in the middle

1487
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,980
 and then crankshafts and pulleys

1488
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:40,820
 that powered all the

1489
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,300
 the equipment and it was all distributed.

1490
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,260
 But you tried to have it as close to the steam engine

1491
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,860
 as possible because if you make the

1492
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,460
 crankshaft too long, it would break the torsion.

1493
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,320
 When they introduced electricity, he found that in factory after factory,

1494
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:53,900
 they would

1495
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,140
 pull out the steam engine

1496
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,800
 and they would get the biggest electric motor

1497
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,420
 they could find

1498
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:03,140
 and put it where the steam engine used to be and fire it up.

1499
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:06,220
 But it didn't really change production a whole lot.

1500
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,460
 You can see that that's not a big deal.

1501
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,100
So then they started building entirely new factories 

1502
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,500
from scratch in a new location.

1503
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:12,960
 What did those look like?

1504
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,480
 Just like the old ones.

1505
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,080
 They would take the same model, some engineer would make a blueprint,

1506
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:19,920
 you know, maybe take

1507
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:23,240
 a big X where the steam engine says, "No, no, put an electric motor here,"

1508
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:23,420
 and they'd

1509
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,700
 go and build a fresh factory.

1510
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,640
 Again, not a big improvement in productivity.

1511
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,060
 It took about 30 years

1512
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,740
 before you started seeing a fundamentally different kind of factory,

1513
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,040
 where instead of having the central power source, you know,

1514
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,060
 a big one in the middle,

1515
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,960
 you had distributed power because electric motors, as you guys know,

1516
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:41,680
 you can make them

1517
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,040
 big, you can make them medium, you can make them really, really small,

1518
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,620
 you can have them

1519
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,800
 all connected in different ways.

1520
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,540
 So, they started having each piece of equipment have

1521
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,620
 a separate piece of a separate motor instead of one big one.

1522
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,040
 They called it unit drive

1523
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:55,880
 instead of group drive.

1524
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:00,120
 I went and read the books in Baker Library at Harvard Business

1525
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,820
 School from like 1914

1526
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,440
 and it was like this whole debate

1527
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,480
 about unit drive versus group

1528
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:05,820
 drive.

1529
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,160
 Well when they started doing that then they had a new line of factories

1530
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,600
 where it was typically on a single story

1531
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,540
 where the machinery was not based on how

1532
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:19,080
 much power it needed but based on the on something else,

1533
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,480
 a flow of materials and

1534
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,820
 you started having these assembly line systems.

1535
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,360
 That led to a huge improvement

1536
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:29,960
 in productivity like a doubling of productivity or tripling in some cases.

1537
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,300
 So the lesson is not that electricity was a fad or a dud and was overhyped.

1538
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,080
Electricity was a fundamentally valuable technology, 

1539
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,820
but it wasn't until they had that process innovation, 

1540
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,480
that organizational innovation of rethinking how to do production, 

1541
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,040
that you got the big payoff.

1542
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,740
 There's a lot of stories like that.

1543
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,800
 I only told you one of them.

1544
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,340
 We don't have that much time, so I'll tell you the other ones.

1545
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,600
But in some of my books and articles, 

1546
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,940
if you look at the steam engine and others, you had similar, you know, 

1547
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,604
you had similar generational lags 

1548
01:05:01,604 --> 01:05:03,480
decades before people realize 

1549
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,060
that this technology could allow you to do something 

1550
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,780
completely different than you used to do.

1551
01:05:07,423 --> 01:05:09,860
 I think AI is a bit like that in some ways 

1552
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,980
that there's going to be a lot of organizational innovations, 

1553
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,220
going to be new business models, 

1554
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,640
new ways of organizing an economy 

1555
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,020
that we hadn't thought of before.

1556
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,240
 Right now people are mostly just retrofitting.

1557
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,800
 I could go through a whole other set of skill changes that are complementary.

1558
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,460
 I don't know what they all are.

1559
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,260
You know, you have to be creative to think about them, 

1560
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,900
but that's what the gap is.

1561
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,000
 In the case of

1562
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,840
 early computers,

1563
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:38,140
 it's literally like 10 times more investment in organizational capital

1564
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,440
and human capital, 

1565
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:44,000
if you look at the size of the investments to the hardware and software.

1566
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,160
 So that's very big.

1567
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:46,900
 That said,

1568
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:54,940
 I'm open to adjusting my thoughts on this a bit because ChatGPT and some of

1569
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,460
 the other tools,

1570
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,980
 they have been adopted very quickly and they have much more quickly been

1571
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,420
to change things in part 

1572
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:05,100
because you don't need to learn Python 

1573
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,120
to the same degree.

1574
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,420
 You can do a lot of things just in English,

1575
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,940
 or you can get a lot of value

1576
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,660
 just by putting them on top of the existing organization.

1577
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,620
 So, some of it's happening faster,

1578
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,500
 and in some of the papers that you may have read for the readings here,

1579
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,780
 we had like 15, 20,

1580
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,940
 30 percent productivity gains pretty quickly.

1581
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,960
 But my suspicion is that it will be even bigger once

1582
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,100
 figure out these complementary innovations.

1583
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,800
 And so that's a long way of answering your

1584
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,980
 question about it's not just that the technical skills

1585
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,520
 is figuring out all the other stuff,

1586
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,480
 all the ways of rethinking things.

1587
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,920
 So those of you who are at the business school or in

1588
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,440
 economics,

1589
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,720
 there's a lot of opportunity there to rethink your areas now that you've been

1590
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,080
 given this amazing set of technologies.

1591
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:51,900
 Yeah, question.

1592
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,200
 It seems like you're expressing

1593
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:01,560
more caution than Eric was with regard to the speed of transformation.

1594
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,860
 Am I correct in-?

1595
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,580
 Well, so I would make a distinction between two things.

1596
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,060
 I'll defer to him and others on the technologies.

1597
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,900
We're going to hear from several other folks, 

1598
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,560
and there are people who are equally optimistic as him 

1599
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,580
or even more optimistic on the technology side.

1600
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,640
 There's also people who are less optimistic.

1601
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,180
 But technology alone is not enough to create

1602
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,920
productivity so you can have an amazing technology 

1603
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,620
and then for various reasons.

1604
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,540
 A, maybe people just don't figure out an effective way to use it.

1605
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,640
 Another is it may be regulatory things.

1606
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,640
I mean some of my computer science colleagues introduced, you know, 

1607
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,480
developed better radiology systems for reading medical images.

1608
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,220
They weren't adopted because of cultural, you know, 

1609
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,460
people just didn't want them.

1610
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,560
 They didn't want, and there are safety reasons.

1611
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,480
When I did an analysis of which tasks AI could help the most 

1612
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,160
and which professions were most

1613
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:56,540
 affected.

1614
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,720
I was surprised that airline pilots was kind of near the top, 

1615
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,760
but I think that a lot of people 

1616
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,420
would not feel comfortable not having the pilot go down with you.

1617
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,820
 So they sort of you want to have the human in there.

1618
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,620
 So there are a lot of different things that might slow it down significantly.

1619
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,720
 And I think that's something we need to to be conscious of.

1620
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,200
And if we could address those bottlenecks, 

1621
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,660
that would probably do more for productivity 

1622
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,080
than than just working on the technology  alone.

1623
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:27,920
 Yeah, question.

1624
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,960
 So Eric had an interesting comment on data centers in

1625
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:33,540
 universities.

1626
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,680
 I think this is a larger point of like...

1627
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,420
 And I was going to ask him why didn't he write a checkbook?

1628
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:41,319
 People are asking him that question.

1629
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,200
 Sort of like what is the role of the university ecosystem?

1630
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:50,939
 Obviously there's this larger, I'm sure all of the CS professors here...

1631
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:53,720
 So I'll take, I mean I think it would be great if there were more funding.

1632
01:08:53,859 --> 01:08:56,160
 I mean the federal government has something called the National AI

1633
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,300
resource that is helping a little bit, 

1634
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:02,399
but it's in like the millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars, 

1635
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,180
not billions of dollars, let alone hundreds of billions of dollars.

1636
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,200
Although Eric did mention to me before class 

1637
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,279
that they're working on something 

1638
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,060
that could be much, much bigger.

1639
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,460
 He's pushing for something much, much bigger.

1640
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,160
 I don't know if it'll happen.

1641
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,779
 That's for training these really large models.

1642
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,000
 I had a really interesting conversation with Jeff Hinton once.

1643
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:20,859
Jeff Hinton, as you know, 

1644
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:24,300
is sort of like one of the godfathers of deep learning.

1645
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:30,140
 and I asked him what kind of hardware he found most useful for doing his work.

1646
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:34,500
 And he was sitting at his laptop and kind of just tapped his MacBook.

1647
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,880
 And it just reminded me

1648
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,140
 there's a whole other set of research

1649
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,720
 that maybe universities have a competitive advantage in,

1650
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:46,000
which is not training $100 billion models, 

1651
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:50,040
but it's innovating new algorithms like whatever comes after Transformers.

1652
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,420
 And there's a lot of other ways that people can make contributions.

1653
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,680
 So maybe there's a little bit of a divisional labor.

1654
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:01,820
 I'm all for and support my colleagues asking for more budgets for GPUs.

1655
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:07,200
 But that's not always where academics can make the biggest contributions.

1656
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,920
 Some of it comes from ideas

1657
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,560
 and new ways of different perspectives

1658
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,300
 about thinking about

1659
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,360
 things, new approaches.

1660
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,760
 And that's likely where we have an advantage.

1661
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,340
 I had dinner with Sendhil Mullainathan last week.

1662
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,380
 He just moved from Chicago to MIT.

1663
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:24,900
 And

1664
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,700
 he was a researcher.

1665
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,320
 We were talking about what is the comparative advantage of universities.

1666
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,700
 And he made the case, you know, patience is one of them.

1667
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,340
 That there are people at universities

1668
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,820
 who are working on very long-term projects.

1669
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,360
 You know, there's people working on fusion.

1670
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,060
 They've been working on fusion for a long time.

1671
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,960
 Not because they're going to get, you

1672
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,380
 know, a lot of money this year or 10 years from now, probably,

1673
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,320
 from building a fusion

1674
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,360
 plant or even 20 years.

1675
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,300
 I don't know how long it is for fusion.

1676
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,020
 But it's just something that people

1677
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,740
 are willing to work on, even if the timelines are

1678
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,160
 a little further.

1679
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:57,520
 It's harder for companies to afford to have

1680
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,360
 those kinds of timelines.

1681
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,360
 So there's a comparative advantage or divisional labor

1682
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,700
 in terms of what universities might be able to do.

1683
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,920
 We have just a couple of minutes left.

1684
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,040
 This is kind of fun.

1685
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,420
 So we'll just do one or two more questions.

1686
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,020
 And then I want to talk a little bit about the projects.

1687
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,200
 Yeah.

1688
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:10,900
 Go ahead.

1689
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,380
 Yeah.

1690
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,380
 I'm a coven.

1691
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,560
 I was wondering about the emerging capabilities of AI that we were discussing.

1692
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,000
 >> Yeah.

1693
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,040
 >> It seemed that Eric was leaning more towards

1694
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,080
 the architectural differences and designing better models versus last class.

1695
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,520
 We talked about Moore's Law instead.

1696
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,140
 I wonder how you sort of-

1697
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,020
 Well, he said all three.

1698
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,740
 So you guys remember the scaling laws?

1699
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,220
 had like three parts to it.

1700
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,760
 think I put the scaling law that like Dario and team.

1701
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,820
 So it's more compute, more data,

1702
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,400
 algorithmic improvements including more parameters.

1703
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,000
 And all three of them-- I think I heard Eric say all three of them--

1704
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,380
 were important.

1705
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,720
 But not to be dismissed, this last one, like new architectures,

1706
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,540
 all three of them,

1707
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,780
 I think, are being important.

1708
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,980
 So I think there was a question in there, though, also.

1709
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:55,820
 Was there?

1710
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,380
 So how much closer are we to AGI type systems, like these low-curve models?

1711
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,300
 Is that fair?

1712
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:07,880
 So Eric doesn't think we're that close to AGI type systems,

1713
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:08,500
 although I don't think

1714
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,660
 it's a sharp definition.

1715
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,960
 In fact, I was going to ask him that question,

1716
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,620
 but we ran out of time.

1717
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,740
 Would have been good to hear him describe it.

1718
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:20,480
 But when I was talking to him, it's just not that sharply

1719
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,220
 a defined thing.

1720
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,180
 In some ways, AGI is already here.

1721
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,540
 Peter Norvig wrote an article called AGI is Already Here.

1722
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,260
 I don't know if it's in the reading packet.

1723
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,080
 I think if it's not, I'll put it in there.

1724
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:37,560
 It's a fun little article with Blaise Agüera y Arcas .

1725
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,200
 And a lot of the things that 20 years ago people

1726
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,740
 would have said, this is what AGI is,

1727
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,200
 that's kind of what LLMs are doing.

1728
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,620
 Not as well, maybe, but it's sort of solving problems

1729
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,020
 in a more general way.

1730
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,320
 On the other hand, there's obviously many things

1731
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,160
 they do much worse than humans currently.

1732
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:00,440
 Ironically, physical tasks are one of the ones

1733
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,600
 that humans have a comparative advantage in right now.

1734
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,060
 And there's something you guys may know of Moravec's paradox,

1735
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,380
 Hans Moravec pointed out

1736
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,260
 that often the kinds of things

1737
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,780
 that a three-year-old or a four-year-old

1738
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:18,420
 can do, like buttoning a shirt or walking up stairs,

1739
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,060
 are very hard to get a machine to be

1740
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:20,440
 able to do.

1741
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,720
Whereas a lot of things that a lot of PhDs have trouble doing, 

1742
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,600
like solving convex

1743
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,800
 optimization problems, are things that machines are often quite good at.

1744
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,860
 So it's not quite a...

1745
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,460
 things that are easy for humans

1746
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,940
 and hard for computers

1747
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,360
 and other things that are hard for

1748
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,640
 humans and easy for computers

1749
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,260
 that they're not like a the same scale

1750
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,540
 and next week we have Mira Marotti a

1751
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:46,820
 chief technology officer of open AI

1752
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,560
 briefly the CEO of open AI and

1753
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,020
 So come with your questions for her.

1754
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:52,600
 We'll see you
