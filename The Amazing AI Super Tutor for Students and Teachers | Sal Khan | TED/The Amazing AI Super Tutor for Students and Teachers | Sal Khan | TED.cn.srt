1
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:08,421
所以任何在过去几个月一直关注的人
So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months

2
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,547
都会看到这样的标题，
has been seeing headlines like this,

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,674
尤其是在教育领域。
especially in education.

4
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,636
论题一直是：
The thesis has been:

5
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:18,472
学生将使用ChatGPT和其他形式的AI
students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI

6
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:20,015
来作弊，完成作业。
to cheat, do their assignments.

7
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:21,349
他们不会学到东西。
They’re not going to learn.

8
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,937
这将彻底破坏我们所知的教育。
And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it.

9
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:27,064
现在，我今天要争论的是，
Now, what I'm going to argue today

10
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:29,816
不仅有办法可以缓解所有这些问题，
is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that,

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,444
如果我们设置正确的护栏，做正确的事情，
if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things,

12
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,612
我们可以减轻它的影响。
we can mitigate it.

13
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,990
但我认为我们正处于利用AI的边缘
But I think we're at the cusp of using AI

14
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,034
可能是教育有史以来最大的积极变革
for probably the biggest positive transformation

15
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:42,496
我们将如何实现这一点
that education has ever seen.

16
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,623
是通过给地球上的每个学生一个智能的，但惊人的个人导师。
And the way we're going to do that

17
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,502
我们将给地球上的每个老师一个惊人的，
is by giving every student on the planet

18
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:51,171
人工智能教学助手。
an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor.

19
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:54,758
我们将为全球的每位教师提供一个令人惊叹的，
And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing,

20
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,386
人工智能教学助手。
artificially intelligent teaching assistant.

21
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:01,349
而且为了让我们明白这有多大的事情
And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be

22
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:04,017
要给每个人一个私人家教，
to give everyone a personal tutor,

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,063
来看一下这段视频
I show you this clip

24
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:10,108
来自本杰明·布鲁姆1984年的二阶跃升研究，
from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study,

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,526
他称之为“二阶跃升问题”。
or he called it the “2 sigma problem.”

26
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,778
二阶跃升来自于两个标准差，
The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation,

27
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:16,822
sigma，即标准差的符号。
sigma, the symbol for standard deviation.

28
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:20,409
他有很好的数据表明，看，一个正态分布，
And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution,

29
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,161
那是你在传统的钟形曲线上看到的那种
that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve

30
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:26,331
就在中间，这就是世界如何寻求平衡的，
right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out,

31
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:31,045
如果你为学生提供个性化的一对一辅导，
that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students,

32
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,340
那么你实际上可以得到一个类似这样的分布。
then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right.

33
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:36,383
它写着1对1的个别辅导（带星号），
It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks,

34
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:37,885
就像是那个正确的分布，
like, that right distribution,

35
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,677
两个标准差的提高。
a two standard-deviation improvement.

36
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:41,389
用简单的语言来说，
Just to put that in plain language,

37
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:45,142
这可以把你的普通学生变成一个优秀的学生。
that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student.

38
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,519
它可以把你的低于平均水平的学生
It can take your below-average student

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,313
变成一个高于平均水平的学生。
and turn them into an above-average student.

40
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:54,527
现在他把这当作一个问题来提出，是因为他说,
Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said,

41
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,903
嗯，这一切都挺好的，
well, this is all good,

42
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,656
但是您如何以这种方式实际扩展集体教学？
but how do you actually scale group instruction this way?

43
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:01,825
如何以经济的方式让所有人都得到这个东西？
How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way?

44
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,037
我马上要向您展示的是我认为向这个方向迈出的第一步。
What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that.

45
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,832
显然，我们在过去十年里一直在尝试以某种方式逼近它，
Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way

46
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,876
在可汗学院（Khan Academy），
at Khan Academy for over a decade now,

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,088
但我认为我们正处于加速实现它的关键时刻。
but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically.

48
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,257
我要向您展示我们的人工智能（AI）处于初级阶段，
I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI,

49
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,135
我们称之为 Khanmigo，
which we call Khanmigo,

50
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,012
它现在能做什么
what it can now do

51
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,890
或许还有一点关于它实际上要去哪里。
and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going.

52
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,268
所以这里就是一个传统的练习
So this right over here is a traditional exercise

53
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:31,439
你们或你们的孩子可能在可汗学院上见过。
that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy.

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,608
但新鲜的是右边那个小机器人。
But what's new is that little bot thing at the right.

55
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,530
我们将首先了解一下非常重要的安全措施，
And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards,

56
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,741
即对话被记录并且可以让您的老师查看。
which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher.

57
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,076
实际上，它由第二个AI进行监控。
It’s moderated actually by a second AI.

58
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,038
而且它不会告诉你答案。
And also it does not tell you the answer.

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,330
它不是作弊工具。
It is not a cheating tool.

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,415
当学生说：“告诉我答案，”
When the student says, "Tell me the answer,"

61
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:51,666
它说：“我是你的导师。
it says, "I'm your tutor.

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,545
你认为解决这个问题的下一步是什么？
What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?"

63
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:57,755
现在，如果学生犯了一个错误，这会让人们感到惊讶
Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people

64
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,634
认为大型语言模型在数学上表现不佳的人，
who think large language models are not good at mathematics,

65
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,760
注意到，它不仅发现了错误，
notice, not only does it notice the mistake,

66
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,265
还要求学生解释他们的推理，
it asks the student to explain their reasoning,

67
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,267
但它实际上正在做的，我会说，
but it's actually doing what I would say,

68
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:10,769
不只是一个普通的导师会做的事，而是一个优秀的导师会做的事。
not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do.

69
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:16,066
它能够洞察到学生心中可能存在的误解，
It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind,

70
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,737
他们可能没有使用分配律。
that they probably didn’t use the distributive property.

71
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,029
请记住，我们需要将负二分配给括号内的9和2m。
Remember, we need to distribute the negative two

72
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,491
将负二分配给括号里的9和2m。
to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses.

73
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,743
对我来说，这是非常非常非常重要的。
This to me is a very, very, very big deal.

74
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,496
这不仅仅是数学中的。
And it's not just in math.

75
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:32,667
这是一个在可汗学院的计算机编程练习，
This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy,

76
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,502
学生需要让云彩分开。
where the student needs to make the clouds part.

77
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:40,840
所以我们可以看到学生开始定义一个变量，左X递减。
And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus.

78
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,468
这只让左边的云彩分开了。
It only made the left cloud part.

79
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,762
但后来他们可以问可汗米戈，怎么回事？
But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on?

80
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:46,723
为什么只有左边的云在移动？
Why is only the left cloud moving?

81
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,306
它能理解代码。
And it understands the code.

82
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:51,185
它了解学生正在做的事情的所有上下文，
It knows all the context of what the student is doing,

83
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:54,689
并且知道这些省略号是为了画出云彩，
and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds,

84
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:57,023
我觉得这真的令人吹破眼球。
which I think is kind of mind-blowing.

85
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,444
它说,"要让正确的云朵也移动，
And it says, "To make the right cloud move as well,

86
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:01,862
尝试在draw函数中添加一行代码，
try adding a line of code inside the draw function

87
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:05,406
每一帧都让右边的X变量增加一个像素。"
that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame."

88
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:10,204
现在，这个可能更令人惊讶，因为我们有很多数学老师。
Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers.

89
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,499
我们一直都在尝试教世界编程，
We've all been trying to teach the world to code,

90
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,208
但是计算机老师并不多。
but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there.

91
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,836
你刚才看到的，即使在我辅导孩子的时候，
And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids,

92
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,295
当他们学习编程时，
when they're learning to code,

93
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,507
我无法这么好、这么快地帮助他们，
I can't help them this well, this fast,

94
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,842
这真的将成为一个超级导师。
this is really going to be a super tutor.

95
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,762
而且它不仅仅是练习题。
And it's not just exercises.

96
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,555
它理解你正在观看什么。
It understands what you're watching.

97
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,599
它理解你视频的语境。
It understands the context of your video.

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,728
它可以回答那个古老的问题：“我为什么需要学习这个？”
It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?”

99
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,481
它用苏格拉底式的方法问："那么，你关心什么？"
And it asks Socratically, "Well, what do you care about?"

100
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:40,651
假设学生说：“我想成为一名职业运动员。”
And let's say the student says, "I want to be a professional athlete."

101
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,402
它说，"了解细胞的大小，
And it says, "Well, learning about the size of cells,

102
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,823
这就是这个视频的内容，
which is what this video is,

103
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:47,698
这对于理解营养
that could be really useful for understanding nutrition

104
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:49,494
以及你的身体如何运作等等都非常有用。"
and how your body works, etc."

105
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:51,538
它可以回答问题，可以对你进行测验，
It can answer questions, it can quiz you,

106
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,164
它可以将其与其他想法联系起来，
it can connect it to other ideas,

107
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:55,541
现在你可以向一个视频提问
you can now ask as many questions of a video

108
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,252
如你所愿。
as you could ever dream of.

109
00:04:57,252 --> 00:05:01,171
(掌声)
(Applause)

110
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:02,965
另一个严重的短缺问题，
Another big shortage out there,

111
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,801
我记得我上的那所高中，
I remember the high school I went to,

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,971
学生到辅导员的比例大约是200到300比1。
the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one.

113
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:12,349
很多地方的情况比这更糟。
A lot of the country, it's worse than that.

114
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,062
我们可以利用Khanmigo为每个学生提供指导员，
We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor,

115
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:19,565
学术教练、职业教练、生活教练，
academic coach, career coach, life coach,

116
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:22,024
就像你在这里看到的那样。
which is exactly what you see right over here.

117
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,152
我们在GPT-4发布时推出了这个。
And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch.

118
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,031
我们有几千人注册了。
We have a few thousand people on this.

119
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,198
这不是一个假的演示，
This isn't a fake demo,

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,159
这就是它在实际操作中的样子。
this is really it in action.

121
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:34,412
然后，你知道，
And then there is, you know,

122
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,873
有些事情我觉得会更困难，
things that I think it would have been even harder,

123
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,209
要做到这点，甚至对一个传统导师来说都像是科幻小说。
it would have been a little science fiction to do

124
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,668
我们与亚利桑那州立大学一起运营一个名为Khan World School的在线高中。
with even a traditional tutor.

125
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,505
其中有一位来自印度的学生正在上这个在线学校。
We run an online high school with Arizona State University

126
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,048
她叫Saanvi。
called Khan World School,

127
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:48,593
她正在做一篇关于《了不起的盖茨比》的报告。
and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India.

128
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,220
在她阅读《了不起的盖茨比》时，
Her name's Saanvi.

129
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:53,600
她当时正在做关于《了不起的盖茨比》的报告。
And she was doing a report on "The Great Gatsby."

130
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,726
当她阅读《了不起的盖茨比》时，
And when she was reading "The Great Gatsby,"

131
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:58,936
杰伊·盖茨比一直望着远处的绿灯。
Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance.

132
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,815
她想，“他为什么这么做？”
And she's like, "Why does he do that?"

133
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,901
她在网上搜寻了一下，显然人们已经研究过这个问题了，
She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this

134
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,902
并对这个象征做了评论，
and commented about the symbolism of that,

135
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:08,071
但她觉得这些都不是她想要的答案。
but none of it was really resonating with her.

136
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:10,491
然后她意识到她有Khanmigo应用
And then she realized that she had Khanmigo

137
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,577
她可以直接与杰伊·盖茨比交谈。
and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself.

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,996
于是，“啊，好主意，老运动员。
And so, "Ah, splendid choice, old sport.

139
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,206
我现在就是杰伊·盖茨比，那个神秘的百万富翁，
I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire

140
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,543
来自F. 斯科特·菲茨杰拉德的经典作品。”
from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.”

141
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:23,085
那么，"你为什么一直盯着绿光看？"
And so, "Why do you keep staring at the green light?"

142
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,922
"啊，绿光，老兄。
"Ah, the green light, old sport.

143
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:27,757
你看，它象征着我的梦想和渴望。
It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see.

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,135
它位于黛西·布坎南的码头尽头
It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock

145
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:32,137
在我庄园的对岸海湾。
across the bay from my mansion.

146
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:35,349
我渴望地注视着它，因为它代表着我对过去的向往
I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past

147
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:39,103
以及我与生活中的挚爱黛西重聚的希望。"
and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life."

148
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:43,147
有趣的是，然后萨努维说：“我和他有一次很长的谈话，”
And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,”

149
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,400
她称他为“盖茨比先生”，
she called him “Mr. Gatsby,”

150
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:48,611
最后，她还真的为占用他的时间而道歉。
and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time,

151
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,197
我觉得她这样做非常有礼貌。
which I thought was very polite of her.

152
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,286
但你可以想象这样可以解锁学习文学，学习...
But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ...

153
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,455
你可以和历史人物交谈。
You could talk to historical figures.

154
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:00,540
我们甚至可能会增加一项活动
We're even probably going to add an activity

155
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,625
你可以与密西西比河交谈。
you can talk to like, the Mississippi River.

156
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:06,171
它以一种直到六个月或一年前都是科幻的方式将事物变得生动起来。
It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction

157
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,673
学生们可以和AI进行辩论。
even six months or a year ago.

158
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,469
我们在这里有一个学生就是否应该取消学生贷款进行辩论。
Students can get into debates with the AI.

159
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,721
而这里我们有的是学生在辩论
And we’ve got this here is the student debating

160
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,556
是否应该取消学生债务。
whether we should cancel student debt.

161
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,726
学生反对取消学生债务，
The student is against canceling student debt,

162
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,519
我们已经得到了非常明确的反馈。
and we've gotten very clear feedback.

163
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,022
我们开始在我们的实验学校，可汗世界学校运行它，
We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have,

164
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,190
可汗实验学校。
Khan Lab School.

165
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,609
特别是高中生们，
The students, the high school students especially,

166
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,861
他们说："能够在不担心被评判的情况下调整我的观点，这太神奇了。
they're saying "This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments

167
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,113
这让我更有信心
without fearing judgment.

168
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,908
走进教室，积极参加课堂活动。"
It makes me that much more confident

169
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:36,284
我们都知道，苏格拉底式对话辩论是一种很好的学习方式，
to go into the classroom and really participate."

170
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,579
我们都知道，苏格拉底式对话辩论是一种很好的学习方式，
And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn,

171
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:42,457
但坦白说，对大多数学生来说，这并不适用。
but frankly, it's not out there for most students.

172
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,087
但现在它可以让每个人都能接触到。
But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone.

173
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:51,676
我们在标题中看到很多这样的叙述，
A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been,

174
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,593
“它将为孩子们写作。
"It's going to do the writing for kids.

175
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,470
孩子们不会学会写作。”
Kids are not going to learn to write."

176
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,850
但我们展示了AI不是为你写作，
But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you,

177
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,017
而是与你一起写作。
it writes with you.

178
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,393
所以这是一个小东西，
So this is a little thing,

179
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,478
我八岁的孩子非常喜欢这个，
and my eight year old is addicted to this,

180
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,981
他以前并不是一个喜欢写作的孩子，
and he's not a kid that really liked writing before,

181
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,357
但你可以说，
but you can say,

182
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,943
“我想写一个恐怖故事，”
“I want to write a horror story,”

183
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:12,779
它会说，“啊，一个恐怖故事，多么令人毛骨悚然和令人兴奋。
and it says, "Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling.

184
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,991
让我们一起潜入阴森的影子和令人不寒而栗的谜团的世界。”
Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries."

185
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:19,327
这是一个学生将写两句话，
And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences,

186
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,328
然后AI会写两句话的活动。
and then the AI will write two sentences.

187
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,957
这样，他们在一个故事中共同合作。
And so they collaborate together on a story.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,669
学生写道，“贝阿特丽丝是一个被误解的幽灵。
The student writes, "Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost.

189
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:29,630
她想交朋友，但总是无意中把他们吓跑。”
She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident."

190
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:33,259
AI说，“可怜的贝阿特丽丝，一个孤独的精神渴望友谊。”
And the AI says, "Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship.

191
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,763
有一天她偶然发现了一个废弃的老宅子，等等。
One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion," etc.

192
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,182
我鼓励大家有朝一日尝试这个。
I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this.

193
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:41,059
这真的出乎意料地有趣。
This is surprisingly fun.

194
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,812
现在更直接地满足这个需求。
Now to even more directly hit this use case.

195
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,397
接下来我要展示的是，
And what I'm about to show you,

196
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,899
到目前为止我展示的一切
everything I showed you so far

197
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,152
实际上已经是Khanmigo的一部分了，而我马上要展示的，
is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you,

198
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:54,613
我们还没有向任何人展示过，这是一个原型。
we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype.

199
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,199
我们希望在接下来的几个月内发布它，
We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months,

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,619
这是为了直接使用AI，使用生成式AI，
but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI,

201
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,788
不要破坏英语和语言艺术
to not undermine English and language arts

202
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,457
而是以我们甚至在一年前都无法想象的方式增强它
but to actually enhance it in ways

203
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,666
这是阅读理解。
that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago.

204
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,460
学生们正在阅读史蒂夫·乔布斯在斯坦福的著名演讲。
This is reading comprehension.

205
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:13,673
然后当他们到达某些点时，
The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford.

206
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,676
他们可以点击那个小问题。
And then as they get to certain points,

207
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:18,011
然后AI将以类似苏格拉底式的方式，几乎像是口头考试，
they can click on that little question.

208
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:22,932
询问学生关于事物的问题。
And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam,

209
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,392
AI还可以突出显示文章的部分内容。
ask the student about things.

210
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:26,937
AI可以突出显示短文中的部分内容。
And the AI can highlight parts of the passage.

211
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,854
为什么作者使用了那个词？
Why did the author use that word?

212
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,065
他们的意图是什么？
What was their intent?

213
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,776
这支持他们的论点吗？
Does it back up their argument?

214
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,818
他们可以重新开始做一些事情，
They can start to do stuff that once again,

215
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,613
我们以前从未有能力给每个人提供一个导师，
we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor,

216
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:40,826
每个人一个写作教练，真正深入阅读到这个层次。
everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level.

217
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,370
而且你可以从另一方面看待它。
And you could go on the other side of it.

218
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,831
我们有整个工作流程来帮助他们写作，
And we have whole work flows that helps them write,

219
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:48,541
帮助他们成为写作教练，制定一个大纲。
helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline.

220
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,627
但是一旦学生实际上构建了一个草稿，
But once a student actually constructs a draft,

221
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,922
这就是他们正在构建草稿的地方，
and this is where they're constructing a draft,

222
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,966
他们可以再次寻求反馈，
they can ask for feedback once again,

223
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:58,218
正如你所期望的那样，一位好的写作教练。
as you would expect from a good writing coach.

224
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,221
在这种情况下，学生会说，比如说，
In this case, the student will say, let's say,

225
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,265
“我的证据支持我的论点吗？”
"Does my evidence support my claim?"

226
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:05,726
然后 AI 不仅能够给出反馈，
And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback,

227
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,855
而且它能够突出显示文章的某些部分，并说，
but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says,

228
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,565
“在这段文章中，这并不完全支持你的论点，”
"On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,"

229
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:14,316
但是再次苏格拉底式地说，"你能告诉我们为什么吗？"
but once again, Socratically says, "Can you tell us why?"

230
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:17,111
这样就可以让学生更好地进行写作，
So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer,

231
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:18,530
给他们更多的反馈
giving them far more feedback

232
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,949
比他们以前能得到的要多得多。
than they've ever been able to actually get before.

233
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,494
我们认为这将大大加速写作，而不是削弱它。
And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it.

234
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:29,125
到目前为止，我谈论的一切都是针对学生的。
Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student.

235
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,044
但我们认为这对老师来说同样具有强大的力量
But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher

236
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:34,378
推动更个性化的教育，坦率地说
to drive more personalized education and frankly

237
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,632
为他们自己和他们的学生节省时间和精力。
save time and energy for themselves and for their students.

238
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:40,468
这是Khan Academy上的一次美国历史练习。
So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy.

239
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:44,682
这是关于西班牙-美国战争的一个问题。
It's a question about the Spanish-American War.

240
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,768
首先，这是学生模式。
And at first it's in student mode.

241
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,228
如果你说，“告诉我答案”，它不会直接告诉你答案。
And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer.

242
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,982
它会进入辅导模式。
It's going to go into tutoring mode.

243
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:55,482
老师可以使用的这个小开关，
But that little toggle which teachers have access to,

244
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:58,613
他们可以关闭学生模式，然后变成教师模式。
they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode.

245
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,781
这样做的作用是 --
And what this does is it turns into --

246
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,743
你可以把它看作是一本功能齐全的教师指南。
You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids.

247
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,911
它不仅可以解释答案，
Not only can it explain the answer,

248
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,080
还可以解释如何教授这个问题。
it can explain how you might want to teach it.

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,917
它可以帮助教师准备相关教材。
It can help prepare the teacher for that material.

250
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:14,420
正如你在这里看到的，它还可以帮助他们制定课程计划。
It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there.

251
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,087
它最终将帮助他们创建进度报告
It'll eventually help them create progress reports

252
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,757
并帮助他们最终评分。
and help them, eventually, grade.

253
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:21,217
所以再次强调，教师将大约一半的时间用于
So once again, teachers spend about half their time

254
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,303
这类活动，备课。
with this type of activity, lesson planning.

255
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:25,138
所有这些精力可以回到他们身上
All of that energy can go back to them

256
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,016
或回到他们与实际学生的人际互动。
or go back to human interactions with their actual students.

257
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:34,106
（掌声）
(Applause)

258
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:37,235
所以，你知道，我想要说明的一点。
So, you know, one point I want to make.

259
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,526
这些大型语言模型如此强大，
These large language models are so powerful,

260
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,447
人们可能会忍不住说，好吧，
there's a temptation to say like, well,

261
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,532
所有这些人只是把它们随意放到自己的网站上，
all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites,

262
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,662
这就使得这些应用本身变成了一种商品。
and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities.

263
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,119
我必须告诉你的是，
And what I've got to tell you

264
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,998
这也是为什么我在8月份第一次接触到GPT-4时有两个星期没睡觉的原因之一。
is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks

265
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,877
但我们很快意识到，为了真正让它变得神奇，
when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August.

266
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,339
我认为你在Khanmigo那里看到的有一点点，
But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical,

267
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,590
它并没有像你看到的ChatGPT那样与你互动。
I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit,

268
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,927
它显得更神奇，更像苏格拉底式的，
it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting.

269
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,512
它显然更擅长数学
It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic,

270
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:08,181
它在数学方面明显更强大
it was clearly much better at math

271
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,433
比大多数人习惯思考的要多。
than what most people are used to thinking.

272
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,642
原因是，
And the reason is,

273
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,563
在幕后付出了大量的工作才实现了这一点。
there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen.

274
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:18,109
我可以列举出我们一直在努力的所有事情，
And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on,

275
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,778
许多人为此努力了六七个月，以创造神奇的感觉。
many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical.

276
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,322
但也许最具智力挑战的一个
But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one

277
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:27,659
是我们意识到，这是来自一位OpenAI研究员的想法，
is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher,

278
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,787
我们可以大幅提高其在数学方面的能力
that we could dramatically improve its ability in math

279
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,122
以及其在辅导方面的能力
and its ability in tutoring

280
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:35,292
如果允许AI在发言前思考一下。
if we allow the AI to think before it speaks.

281
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,750
所以，如果你正在辅导某人
So if you're tutoring someone

282
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,963
在评估他们的数学水平之前就开始说话
and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math,

283
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,256
你可能不会做对。
you might not get it right.

284
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,299
但是，如果你为自己构建思想，
But if you construct thoughts for yourself,

285
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:46,177
右边所示的实际 AI 思想，
and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought,

286
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,889
这是它自己生成的内容，但它不与学生共享。
something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student.

287
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,766
那么它的准确性大幅提高了，
then its accuracy went up dramatically,

288
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,729
它成为世界级导师的能力也大大提高了。
and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically.

289
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,854
你可以看到它在这里自言自语。
And you can see it's talking to itself here.

290
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:59,566
它说，“学生得到的答案与我得到的答案不同，
It says, "The student got a different answer than I did,

291
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,568
但不要告诉他们他们犯了一个错误。
but do not tell them they made a mistake.

292
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:05,155
而是请他们解释他们是怎么得出那个步骤的。
Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step."

293
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,991
所以我只是希望能结束这个话题，
So I'll just finish off, hopefully,

294
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:11,536
你知道，我刚刚给你们展示的只是我们正在进行的一半工作，
you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on,

295
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,041
我们认为这只是冰山一角
and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg

296
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,460
这个项目还能发展到哪里去。
of where this can actually go.

297
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,628
而且我相信，尽管一年前我还不会这么想，
And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago,

298
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:25,968
我们大家有机会一起应对 2 sigma 问题，
that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem

299
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,261
并将其变成 2 sigma 的机会，
and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity,

300
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:33,099
大大加速我们现在所知道的教育方式。
dramatically accelerating education as we know it.

301
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:35,852
现在，让我们从更高的层次来看待这个问题，
Now, just to take a step back at a meta level,

302
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:38,646
显然我们今天听到了很多观点，有关辩论的两面。
obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side.

303
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:41,566
有些人对人工智能持较悲观的看法，
There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI,

304
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:42,776
他们认为这很可怕，
they say this is scary,

305
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,277
有很多反乌托邦的情景，
there's all these dystopian scenarios,

306
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,574
我们或许要放慢脚步，甚至暂停。
we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause.

307
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:51,825
另一方面，有些人更乐观，
On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks

308
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,661
他们认为我们已经经历了转折点，
that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before,

309
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,791
我们已经度过了工业革命。
we've gone through the Industrial Revolution.

310
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,166
虽然那个时期也很可怕，但最后事情都解决了。
It was scary, but it all kind of worked out.

311
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,920
而我现在要辩论的是
And what I'd argue right now

312
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,546
我不认为这就像是掷硬币一样
is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin

313
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,759
或者这是我们只需要，
or this is something where we'll just have to,

314
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,053
比如说，等待一下看结果如何的事情。
like, wait and see which way it turns out.

315
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,637
我认为在座的每个人以及更多人
I think everyone here and beyond,

316
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,516
我们都是这个决策的积极参与者。
we are active participants in this decision.

317
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:17,395
我非常确信这种理论的第一条线索
I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning

318
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,064
实际上几乎是一种自我实现的预言，
is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy,

319
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:22,815
如果我们战战兢兢地行动，如果我们说，
that if we act with fear and if we say,

320
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:25,902
“嘿，我们必须停止这些事情，”
"Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,"

321
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:28,947
实际上可能会发生的是，遵守规则的人可能会暂停，
what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause,

322
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,156
可能会减缓速度，
might slow down,

323
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:32,617
但像亚历山大[王]提到的那样，违反规则的人，
but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned,

324
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:35,328
专制政府，犯罪组织，
the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations,

325
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:36,913
他们只会加速。
they're only going to accelerate.

326
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:40,750
这导致了我非常确信的反乌托邦状态，
And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state,

327
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,421
也就是说，好的行为者拥有比坏的行为者更糟糕的AI。
which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors.

328
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:49,092
不过我也会稍微跟乐观主义者聊聊。
But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit.

329
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,551
我并不认为这意味着，
I don't think that means that,

330
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:53,555
哦，那我们就放松，只是抱着最好的希望。
oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best.

331
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,181
那可能也不会发生。
That might not happen either.

332
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:59,728
我认为我们所有人都必须拼命地奋斗，
I think all of us together have to fight like hell

333
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,563
以确保我们设立防护措施，
to make sure that we put the guardrails,

334
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:05,442
在出现问题时，我们制定合理的规定。
we put in -- when the problems arise --

335
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:07,234
但我们为积极的使用案例拼命奋斗。
reasonable regulations.

336
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,406
因为这离我很近，显然还有很多潜在的积极使用案例，
But we fight like hell for the positive use cases.

337
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,407
但也许最强大的使用案例，
Because very close to my heart,

338
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:15,034
也许最具诗意的使用案例，就是如果AI，人工智能，
and obviously there's many potential positive use cases,

339
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,286
但也许最有力的应用场景
but perhaps the most powerful use case

340
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:22,501
或许最富诗意的应用场景是AI，人工智能，
and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence,

341
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:26,255
可以用来提高HI，人类智能，
can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence,

342
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:29,132
人类潜力和人类目标。
human potential and human purpose.

343
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:30,758
谢谢。
Thank you.

344
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:36,515
（掌声）
(Applause)
