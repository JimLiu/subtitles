1
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:08,421
So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months

2
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,547
has been seeing headlines like this,

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,674
especially in education.

4
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,636
The thesis has been:

5
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:18,472
students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI

6
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:20,015
to cheat, do their assignments.

7
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:21,349
They’re not going to learn.

8
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,937
And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it.

9
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:27,064
Now, what I'm going to argue today

10
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:29,816
is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that,

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,444
if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things,

12
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,612
we can mitigate it.

13
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,990
But I think we're at the cusp of using AI

14
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,034
for probably the biggest positive transformation

15
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:42,496
that education has ever seen.

16
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,623
And the way we're going to do that

17
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,502
is by giving every student on the planet

18
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:51,171
an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor.

19
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:54,758
And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing,

20
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,386
artificially intelligent teaching assistant.

21
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:01,349
And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be

22
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:04,017
to give everyone a personal tutor,

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,063
I show you this clip

24
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:10,108
from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study,

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,526
or he called it the “2 sigma problem.”

26
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,778
The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation,

27
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:16,822
sigma, the symbol for standard deviation.

28
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:20,409
And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution,

29
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,161
that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve

30
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:26,331
right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out,

31
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:31,045
that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students,

32
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,340
then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right.

33
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:36,383
It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks,

34
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:37,885
like, that right distribution,

35
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,677
a two standard-deviation improvement.

36
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:41,389
Just to put that in plain language,

37
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:45,142
that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student.

38
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,519
It can take your below-average student

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,313
and turn them into an above-average student.

40
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:54,527
Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said,

41
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,903
well, this is all good,

42
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,656
but how do you actually scale group instruction this way?

43
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:01,825
How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way?

44
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,037
What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that.

45
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,832
Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way

46
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,876
at Khan Academy for over a decade now,

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,088
but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically.

48
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,257
I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI,

49
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,135
which we call Khanmigo,

50
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,012
what it can now do

51
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,890
and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going.

52
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,268
So this right over here is a traditional exercise

53
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:31,439
that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy.

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,608
But what's new is that little bot thing at the right.

55
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,530
And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards,

56
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,741
which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher.

57
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,076
It’s moderated actually by a second AI.

58
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,038
And also it does not tell you the answer.

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,330
It is not a cheating tool.

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,415
When the student says, "Tell me the answer,"

61
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:51,666
it says, "I'm your tutor.

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,545
What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?"

63
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:57,755
Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people

64
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,634
who think large language models are not good at mathematics,

65
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,760
notice, not only does it notice the mistake,

66
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,265
it asks the student to explain their reasoning,

67
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,267
but it's actually doing what I would say,

68
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:10,769
not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do.

69
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:16,066
It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind,

70
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,737
that they probably didn’t use the distributive property.

71
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,029
Remember, we need to distribute the negative two

72
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,491
to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses.

73
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,743
This to me is a very, very, very big deal.

74
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,496
And it's not just in math.

75
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:32,667
This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy,

76
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,502
where the student needs to make the clouds part.

77
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:40,840
And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus.

78
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,468
It only made the left cloud part.

79
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,762
But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on?

80
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:46,723
Why is only the left cloud moving?

81
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,306
And it understands the code.

82
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:51,185
It knows all the context of what the student is doing,

83
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:54,689
and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds,

84
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:57,023
which I think is kind of mind-blowing.

85
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,444
And it says, "To make the right cloud move as well,

86
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:01,862
try adding a line of code inside the draw function

87
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:05,406
that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame."

88
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:10,204
Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers.

89
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,499
We've all been trying to teach the world to code,

90
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,208
but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there.

91
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,836
And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids,

92
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,295
when they're learning to code,

93
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,507
I can't help them this well, this fast,

94
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,842
this is really going to be a super tutor.

95
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,762
And it's not just exercises.

96
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,555
It understands what you're watching.

97
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,599
It understands the context of your video.

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,728
It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?”

99
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,481
And it asks Socratically, "Well, what do you care about?"

100
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:40,651
And let's say the student says, "I want to be a professional athlete."

101
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,402
And it says, "Well, learning about the size of cells,

102
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,823
which is what this video is,

103
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:47,698
that could be really useful for understanding nutrition

104
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:49,494
and how your body works, etc."

105
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:51,538
It can answer questions, it can quiz you,

106
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,164
it can connect it to other ideas,

107
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:55,541
you can now ask as many questions of a video

108
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,252
as you could ever dream of.

109
00:04:57,252 --> 00:05:01,171
(Applause)

110
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:02,965
Another big shortage out there,

111
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,801
I remember the high school I went to,

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,971
the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one.

113
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:12,349
A lot of the country, it's worse than that.

114
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,062
We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor,

115
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:19,565
academic coach, career coach, life coach,

116
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:22,024
which is exactly what you see right over here.

117
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,152
And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch.

118
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,031
We have a few thousand people on this.

119
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,198
This isn't a fake demo,

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,159
this is really it in action.

121
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:34,412
And then there is, you know,

122
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,873
things that I think it would have been even harder,

123
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,209
it would have been a little science fiction to do

124
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,668
with even a traditional tutor.

125
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,505
We run an online high school with Arizona State University

126
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,048
called Khan World School,

127
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:48,593
and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India.

128
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,220
Her name's Saanvi.

129
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:53,600
And she was doing a report on "The Great Gatsby."

130
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,726
And when she was reading "The Great Gatsby,"

131
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:58,936
Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance.

132
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,815
And she's like, "Why does he do that?"

133
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,901
She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this

134
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,902
and commented about the symbolism of that,

135
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:08,071
but none of it was really resonating with her.

136
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:10,491
And then she realized that she had Khanmigo

137
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,577
and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself.

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,996
And so, "Ah, splendid choice, old sport.

139
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,206
I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire

140
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,543
from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.”

141
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:23,085
And so, "Why do you keep staring at the green light?"

142
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,922
"Ah, the green light, old sport.

143
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:27,757
It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see.

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,135
It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock

145
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:32,137
across the bay from my mansion.

146
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:35,349
I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past

147
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:39,103
and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life."

148
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:43,147
And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,”

149
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,400
she called him “Mr. Gatsby,”

150
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:48,611
and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time,

151
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,197
which I thought was very polite of her.

152
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,286
But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ...

153
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,455
You could talk to historical figures.

154
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:00,540
We're even probably going to add an activity

155
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,625
you can talk to like, the Mississippi River.

156
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:06,171
It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction

157
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,673
even six months or a year ago.

158
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,469
Students can get into debates with the AI.

159
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,721
And we’ve got this here is the student debating

160
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,556
whether we should cancel student debt.

161
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,726
The student is against canceling student debt,

162
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,519
and we've gotten very clear feedback.

163
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,022
We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have,

164
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,190
Khan Lab School.

165
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,609
The students, the high school students especially,

166
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,861
they're saying "This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments

167
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,113
without fearing judgment.

168
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,908
It makes me that much more confident

169
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:36,284
to go into the classroom and really participate."

170
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,579
And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn,

171
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:42,457
but frankly, it's not out there for most students.

172
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,087
But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone.

173
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:51,676
A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been,

174
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,593
"It's going to do the writing for kids.

175
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,470
Kids are not going to learn to write."

176
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,850
But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you,

177
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,017
it writes with you.

178
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:01,393
So this is a little thing,

179
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,478
and my eight year old is addicted to this,

180
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,981
and he's not a kid that really liked writing before,

181
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,357
but you can say,

182
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,943
“I want to write a horror story,”

183
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:12,779
and it says, "Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling.

184
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,991
Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries."

185
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:19,327
And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences,

186
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,328
and then the AI will write two sentences.

187
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,957
And so they collaborate together on a story.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,669
The student writes, "Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost.

189
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:29,630
She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident."

190
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:33,259
And the AI says, "Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship.

191
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,763
One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion," etc.

192
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,182
I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this.

193
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:41,059
This is surprisingly fun.

194
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,812
Now to even more directly hit this use case.

195
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,397
And what I'm about to show you,

196
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,899
everything I showed you so far

197
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,152
is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you,

198
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:54,613
we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype.

199
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,199
We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months,

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,619
but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI,

201
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,788
to not undermine English and language arts

202
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,457
but to actually enhance it in ways

203
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,666
that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago.

204
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,460
This is reading comprehension.

205
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:13,673
The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford.

206
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,676
And then as they get to certain points,

207
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:18,011
they can click on that little question.

208
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:22,932
And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam,

209
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,392
ask the student about things.

210
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:26,937
And the AI can highlight parts of the passage.

211
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,854
Why did the author use that word?

212
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,065
What was their intent?

213
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,776
Does it back up their argument?

214
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,818
They can start to do stuff that once again,

215
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,613
we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor,

216
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:40,826
everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level.

217
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,370
And you could go on the other side of it.

218
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,831
And we have whole work flows that helps them write,

219
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:48,541
helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline.

220
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,627
But once a student actually constructs a draft,

221
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,922
and this is where they're constructing a draft,

222
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,966
they can ask for feedback once again,

223
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:58,218
as you would expect from a good writing coach.

224
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,221
In this case, the student will say, let's say,

225
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,265
"Does my evidence support my claim?"

226
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:05,726
And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback,

227
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,855
but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says,

228
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,565
"On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,"

229
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:14,316
but once again, Socratically says, "Can you tell us why?"

230
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:17,111
So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer,

231
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:18,530
giving them far more feedback

232
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,949
than they've ever been able to actually get before.

233
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,494
And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it.

234
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:29,125
Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student.

235
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,044
But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher

236
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:34,378
to drive more personalized education and frankly

237
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,632
save time and energy for themselves and for their students.

238
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:40,468
So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy.

239
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:44,682
It's a question about the Spanish-American War.

240
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,768
And at first it's in student mode.

241
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,228
And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer.

242
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,982
It's going to go into tutoring mode.

243
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:55,482
But that little toggle which teachers have access to,

244
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:58,613
they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode.

245
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,781
And what this does is it turns into --

246
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,743
You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids.

247
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,911
Not only can it explain the answer,

248
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,080
it can explain how you might want to teach it.

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,917
It can help prepare the teacher for that material.

250
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:14,420
It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there.

251
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,087
It'll eventually help them create progress reports

252
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,757
and help them, eventually, grade.

253
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:21,217
So once again, teachers spend about half their time

254
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,303
with this type of activity, lesson planning.

255
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:25,138
All of that energy can go back to them

256
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,016
or go back to human interactions with their actual students.

257
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:34,106
(Applause)

258
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:37,235
So, you know, one point I want to make.

259
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,526
These large language models are so powerful,

260
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,447
there's a temptation to say like, well,

261
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,532
all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites,

262
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,662
and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities.

263
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,119
And what I've got to tell you

264
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,998
is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks

265
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,877
when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August.

266
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,339
But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical,

267
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,590
I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit,

268
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,927
it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting.

269
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,512
It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic,

270
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:08,181
it was clearly much better at math

271
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,433
than what most people are used to thinking.

272
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,642
And the reason is,

273
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,563
there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen.

274
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:18,109
And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on,

275
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,778
many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical.

276
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,322
But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one

277
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:27,659
is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher,

278
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,787
that we could dramatically improve its ability in math

279
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,122
and its ability in tutoring

280
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:35,292
if we allow the AI to think before it speaks.

281
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,750
So if you're tutoring someone

282
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,963
and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math,

283
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,256
you might not get it right.

284
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,299
But if you construct thoughts for yourself,

285
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:46,177
and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought,

286
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,889
something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student.

287
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,766
then its accuracy went up dramatically,

288
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,729
and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically.

289
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,854
And you can see it's talking to itself here.

290
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:59,566
It says, "The student got a different answer than I did,

291
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,568
but do not tell them they made a mistake.

292
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:05,155
Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step."

293
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,991
So I'll just finish off, hopefully,

294
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:11,536
you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on,

295
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,041
and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg

296
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,460
of where this can actually go.

297
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,628
And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago,

298
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:25,968
that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem

299
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,261
and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity,

300
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:33,099
dramatically accelerating education as we know it.

301
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:35,852
Now, just to take a step back at a meta level,

302
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:38,646
obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side.

303
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:41,566
There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI,

304
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:42,776
they say this is scary,

305
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,277
there's all these dystopian scenarios,

306
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,574
we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause.

307
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:51,825
On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks

308
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,661
that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before,

309
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,791
we've gone through the Industrial Revolution.

310
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,166
It was scary, but it all kind of worked out.

311
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,920
And what I'd argue right now

312
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,546
is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin

313
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,759
or this is something where we'll just have to,

314
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,053
like, wait and see which way it turns out.

315
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,637
I think everyone here and beyond,

316
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,516
we are active participants in this decision.

317
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:17,395
I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning

318
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,064
is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy,

319
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:22,815
that if we act with fear and if we say,

320
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:25,902
"Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,"

321
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:28,947
what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause,

322
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,156
might slow down,

323
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:32,617
but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned,

324
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:35,328
the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations,

325
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:36,913
they're only going to accelerate.

326
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:40,750
And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state,

327
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,421
which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors.

328
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:49,092
But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit.

329
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,551
I don't think that means that,

330
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:53,555
oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best.

331
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,181
That might not happen either.

332
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:59,728
I think all of us together have to fight like hell

333
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,563
to make sure that we put the guardrails,

334
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:05,442
we put in -- when the problems arise --

335
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:07,234
reasonable regulations.

336
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,406
But we fight like hell for the positive use cases.

337
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,407
Because very close to my heart,

338
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:15,034
and obviously there's many potential positive use cases,

339
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,286
but perhaps the most powerful use case

340
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:22,501
and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence,

341
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:26,255
can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence,

342
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:29,132
human potential and human purpose.

343
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:30,758
Thank you.

344
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:36,515
(Applause)
